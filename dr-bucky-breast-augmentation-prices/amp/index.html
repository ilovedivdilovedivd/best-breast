In the latter situation , the implant will migrate all the way to the far bottom of your stretched out breast envelope, filling out the lower pole and leaving the upper pole stretched, flat, and deflated.</p><p>This appears sort of like a “rock in a sock,” and it is equally unattractive as a Snoopy breast, as there is still no tone in the breast, the tissues compete with the implant, and the placement is all wrong.</p><p>Furthermore, the larger the implant used, the more stress and stretch that is imparted to the tissues, and the worse this is.</p><p>In both of these instances, one of the fundamental problems is that a low nipple goes unaddressed for the most part, and we are left with simply a larger version of a saggy breast.</p><p>In the event that you are like some ladies I have encountered through the years and would be happy with simply larger breasts that you can lift up in a bra, and one of those two likely scenarios that I described above would not bother you, then your current surgeon’s plan will probably be the simplest, easiest way to enlarge your breasts and meet your goals.</p><p>However, if you are like most of the patients that I encounter and want an attractive position, shape, and size to your breasts, starting from where it appears that you are starting, I would strongly recommend that you consider a lift.</p><p>Nobody likes to undergo more surgery than they need, but nobody likes to undergo surgery and be disappointed with their results either. If your surgeon is not willing to reconsider the options of a lift, and you feel as though that might be a better option for you, I would strongly suggest that you at least obtain a couple of other opinions from board certified plastic surgeons who have a lot of experience in breast surgery before you commit to surgery on April 6.</p><p>Now is the time to get all of your questions answered and make sure that the plan is one that is likely to meet your personal goals, not after you have undergone surgery. Your research is pointing you in the right direction, and I think your instincts are correct; just take it one step further and get some other opinions.</p><p><b>Are 500cc saline implants too big for me? Want to be 34D. Maybe 475 cc or 450 cc? </b></p><p>The differences in 50 cvs is nothing. To see true difference at least 100 cvs ranges are needed. So 450 to 500 ccs are in a range that if I were choosing the 450 might fit your desires more.</p><p><i>Implants stay soft </i></p><p>The problem with hardening of breast implants over time is called capsular contracture. Whether one has saline or silicone filled implants, the implant itself does not harden . After placement of an implant, the body forms a wall of scar tissue, better known as a capsule, around it that in most situations remains thin and large enough to allow the implant to feel soft and natural.</p><p>In a small percentage of women, the capsule starts to shrink or contract in size. This decreases the space for the implant to lie in and thus manifests itself to the patient as a hard implant and distorted breast.</p><h5>Breast Implants too Big</h5><p>We are all telling you this is a bad idea. graph you have provided, and what you’ve said about not wanting upper pole fulness, you will not be happy with your choice of 800 cc HP.</p><p>HP is all about more pronounced upper pole fullness, and an 800 cc implant has no where to go on you but up. Looking at your photograph, your nipple to inframammary fold distance appears relatively short, which means he will have to significantly lower your fold to properly position this large implant under the breast mound, and to keep your nipples from pointing south.</p><p>Pinch your skin just under your breast; that will be all that is covering the bottom of the implant afterward. </p><p>One other thing to consider is that this will not be a reversable event in case you think you’ll just go for it, and if you don’t like it, you’ll just ‘change them out for another pair’.</p><p>This will cause irreversable and possibly uncorrectable problems for you. This is really serious! As the others have told you, nows a time to be thoughtful, not rash. I hope you reconsider.</p><p><b>Gummy Bear Breast Implants</b></p><p>Gummy bear implants are silicone implants that are made of a thicker silicone gel. Instead of flowing likes standard implants the gel is more like a soft solid Gummy bear consistency.</p><p>These implants are currently part of several clinical studies at this point and will not be available to the general public until they are FDA approved.</p><h3>Breast augmentation size</h3><p>It’s important to understand your own personal definition of what size you like and it’s equally important that your plastic surgeon gets to know you to understand this as well. What’s helpful to determine whether a size is too big is who you would want to know about your augmentation.</p><p>In general I discuss 3 types of results with my patients , one where only close friends and family would notice, one where acquaintances would notice as well and one where anyone would know. I find this to be a helpful framework to begin the discussion.</p><h3>450 cc implants and postop size</h3><p>Based on your information, it is very likely that 450cc implants with look large on your petite frame. If your goal is to achieve a full C or small D using a 450cc implant, you may actually overshoot your expectations and find that your final bra size is larger.</p><p>In addition, if you feel that the sizers looked big on you, then expect that you will look nearly as large after surgery even after the implants settle.</p><p><strong>Silicone gel filled implants under the breast would probably be best for you. </strong></p><p>For years the use of Silicone gel implants was limited to reconstructive surgery. As a result it became evident that in most women the best place for silicone saline filled implants was under the pectoralis muscle to minimize ripples and folds of the implant being seen through the breast and skin.</p><p>Now with the availability of silicone gel filled implants, I feel that the best augmentations are accomplished with peri areolar {around the colored portion of the nipple) incision, sub mammary placement of silicone gel implants.</p><p>This is particularly true with a patient who has lost some volume and has collapse of the breast with or with out a little ptosis (drooping of the breast). I believe you were given good advice by the second surgeon.</p><p>This is especially true since you have a good deal of natural breast tissue. Ask each of the doctors that you consult to show you some their own patient’s pictures which are similar to you.</p><p>There is no question that the gel will feel and look more natural but you certainly can have a good result from saline under the muscle if you don’t have too much drooping.</p><p><em>In the end you get to choose</em></p><p>Silicone implants are better in feel and look. Saline implants are safer. In the end it will be your choice based on your own outlook on life and risk taking.</p><p><em>Reductive Augmentation</em></p><p>I have developed a technique over the last 15 years for your exact situation. I call it “Reductive Augmentation”. At the same setting, a breast augmentation , full mastopexy (lift), and reduction are performed. By removing the inferior pole breast tissue and placing an implant, the upper pole volume is restored.</p><p>The biggest question is how big and how round. You are an excellent candidate for this procedure.</p><h4>Implants selection</h4><p>You appear to be a good candidate for breast augmentation. I generally prefer under the muscle in thinner patients like you for the long term benefit of more implant coverage.</p><p>I recommend seeing a few plastic surgeons and trying on implant sizers to help determine what size you would like and works with your tissues .</p><h4>Real look</h4><p>Silicone will have less chance of rippling, which can make the results look less natural. Otherwise the implants look the same. They are essentially the same implants, but filled with different material.</p><h4>Will my breasts get bigger?</h4><p>I think you have a very good early result an it will continue to settle down well. The size is unlikely to change noticeably – if anything, they will feel more and more part of you with time.</p><h3>Prices From Realself:</h3><h3>Belotero Prices</h3><p><em>2016:</em></p><ul>
