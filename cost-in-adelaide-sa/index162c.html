After pregnancy your breasts will change – with or without implants. In either circumstance you may want to do something to improve your after-pregnancy appearance, such as a breast lift or new size.</p><p>There is no more pain with implants, and no more greater risk of stretch marks. So, get your implants so you can enjoy yourself as long as you can, then worry later about what you want to do after having children.</p><p><em>Do I need a lift or can I get away with just big implants? </em></p><p>The answer really depends on your goals. You could do just an augment but no matter how big the implants, there is very little if any lift as a result of them. A true lift would give you a much younger and more aesthetic look.</p><p><i>Asymmetry 4 weeks post breast inplants</i></p><p> It is a bit difficult to say as we don’t see a pre op photo. In any case, you are very early in the post operative course. Implants start to fall at 3 weeks.</p><p>It may take several months to see the final result. Keep talking with your plastic surgeon.</p><p><strong>600cc’s is probably bigger than a D</strong></p><p>It is not very predictable to judge an implant size and the resulting bra size. I think the best way to get the size you want is to try on implants to get the look you want and then see what bra size fits you.<br>
I you are concerned about staying with in a certain bra size then take that bra to your sizing and see what size implant fills it up. My experience tells me that 600 cc’s is quite large and will probably make you larger than a D cup.</p><p>An average patient in the mid 400 cc range will be about a D. These are just some vague generalities but I hope it helps you get a sense of what implant sizes will do for you.</p><p>If you are really uncomfortable and unsure, go back in and discuss it with your surgeon before the day of surgery. Dr. Peterson .</p><p><b>650cc Max For My Body?</b></p><p>You will probably be able to find someone willing to do this. Without more info, such as breast width, and an actual exam, it is difficult to recommend a maximum size. Implants that large will look fake and unattractive to many observers, and may set you up for a lifetime of breast surgeries related to the damage that so much stretching of your own natural tissue will be forced to endure.<br>
Ideally your surgeon should limit the size of the implant such that the width of the implant is not greater than the width of your breast. I suspect that even an ultra high profile implant will be too wide at 650 cc.</p><p>Seek additional opinions.</p><h5>Breast augmentation with lift</h5><p>You would benefit from a breast augmentation with lift in Adelaide. Since your breasts are a bit low, you can actually accentuate this by having just the breast augmentation performed. Your best result most likely would involve some type of breast lift.</p><p> Only with a consultation in person and a proper physical examination can a good recommendation be provided. </p><p><strong>Lift or no lift</strong></p><p>in my experience the majority of people with nipples near the bottom of their breasts will desire a lift to elevate the nipples. However, some people choose to have implants alone and are not concerned if the nipples remain low.<br>
 Some of these patients will also choose to have implants at a later date.</p><p><i>Breast feeding is possible after breast augmentation</i></p><p>In general, breast feeding after a breast augmentation in Adelaide should be possible. The implants are always placed behind the breast tissue even if they are placed above the muscle. However, some women are not able to breast feed even without implants.</p><h3>Breast Enlargement Creams</h3><p>There is no evidence that enlargement creams have a long lasting effect. Breast enlargements typically involve implants, or fat transfer.</p><p><i>Silicone implant costs</i></p><p>Silicone implants are priced the same whether they are large or small. Different shaped implants can cost different amounts. The silicone implants are also more expensive than saline.</p><p><strong>Not too old for breast implants</strong></p><p>The answer is heck no, you are not too old. As with most cosmetic procedure, the health of the patient is the most important thing to consider (among many things to consider). Since you are healthy, and providing you have reasonable expectations, there is no reason that you shouldn’t consider implants in Adelaide.</p><h3>Peri areolar or infra mammary incision for breast augmentation</h3><p>I feel that the peri areolar incision is always the best incision for placing breast implants. This incision is almost always very good and hard to see. The infra mammary incision can some times be seen when wearing a bathing suit top and waving the top rides up and the scar becomes visible.</p><p>It is also much more likely to be a bad scar then the peri areolar. Using the peri areolar the surgeon can place a textured gel breast implant either under the breast or in the dual plane (under the breast on the bottom half and under the muscle in the top half).</p><p>This implant is less likely to show ripples, develop a capsular contraction or slide out into your arm pit or migrate down your chest wall (bottom out). The other incision choice is the trans axillary but I reserve this for sub muscular implantation and you can not accurately position a textured implant through this incision but is good for smooth wall gel implants and saline implants.<br>
Admittedly, most plastic surgeons will place the implant under the muscle, particularly if the patient does not have a great deal of breast tissue.</p><p><strong>Breast implant lifespan</strong></p><p>Adelaide Breast Implants are a man made product, they eventually wear out and leak. Just like cars do not last forever, planes fall out of the sky, trains fall off tracks, global warming the wourld is falling apart etc, etc.</p><p>How long they can last is controversial; most manufacturers and plastic surgery societies say they should be changed every 10 years. I am not convinced this has to be done, being in practice over 12 years I have seen many patients with them longer and have not had any problems.</p><p>If they are around 8-10 years and you have problems like capsular contracture, leaking etc then the should be changed, but if you like the way they look and feel I do not think you have to change them.</p><h3>Transaxillary incision has the most problems.</h3><p>When I am doing breast augmentation surgery in Adelaide, I use the transaxillary approach. But not too many patients are good candidates. So I recommend it seldom. Unless the surgery is done perfectly on the right patient (long distance between the nipple and the fold, with no sagging), the implants will end up too high.</p><p>It is hard to make the pocket low enough through the axilla. Let me assure you of something else. If you are not happy afterwards, it is not going to be because of the scar.</p><p>Scars under the breast or under the nipple are short, and they fade, and nobody complains about them. If you are not happy afterwards, it will be because the SHAPE is not right. There is nothing magical about the armpit scar.</p><p>Go to the surgeon who can show you lots of before and after pictures with great shape.</p><p><strong>Over the Muscle – the Best Choice?</strong></p><p>You will hear many different opinions. The correct answer has to do with surgeons preference and patients physical exam. Your prospective surgeon have a clear advantage over any body else who has not have the opportunity to exam you.</p><p>In my opinion, if you are a weight lifter ,and you have a thick skin, (the upper, lateral and medial pinch test measures more than 2 cm). Breast augmentation over the musclein Adelaide will work well reducing the risk of visual ripping over the upper medial ,lateral part of the breast.</p><p>On the other hand, if you have thin skin , then dual implant placement will be my choice.<br>
<i>Trust Your Surgeon’s Guidance</i></p><p>Please be aware that my comments here are general and can’t be taken as specific medical advice. First, it’s very important to communicate to your surgeon your concerns about how the high profile implants appear on patients with similar sized bodies.</p><p>A high profile implant has a narrower base than a round moderate plus implant, and it projects further out from the body. It is common with patients who want a rounder, fuller appearance with more cleavage than implants with less projection.</p><p>Because the round moderate plus implants have a slightly wider base, the results generally appear more natural. Attending a surgeon who offers 3D Vectra imaging might help you know how a given implant will look specifically on you, as it involves taking photos of your chest and then creating computer generated images based on size and shape of implant.<br>
<em>False breast exam findings</em></p><p>There have been many studies that show that leaking silicone does not pose any risks to systemic disease or collagen vascular disorders.</p><p>The older implants had a thin shell that would leak or disintegrate quite often. </p><p>Usually, the silicone gel would be contained within the scar capsule. 4- Some of the silicone may leak into the nearby tissues and lymph nodes.</p><p>Of note, and not mentioned previously, some silicone in the breast tissue may become inflamed and present as a mass or nodule in the breast. You cannot pass this off as nothing,because of the risk of a missed breast nodule of a dubious nature.</p><p>Therefore you have to biopsy these nodules as they become apparent. Therefore it is essential to change ruptured or leaking silicone implants. Finally, replacement can be performed at the same time and the newer cohesive gel implants should not have the same risks as previous generation implants.<br>
<b>Breast Implant Size should be made BY THE PATIENT (with Surgeon guidance)</b></p><p>The question as to WHO choses the implant is easy – The patient does. But the surgeon needs to influence that decision based on his/her experience and then decide if to accomodate that choice and actually perform the breast augmentation surgery or not.</p><p>A lot of Plastic surgeons, especially in these tough economic times, will shrug off this ethical decision as impractical, saying that if he/she does not give the patient the implants she insists on, someone else surely will.</p><p>That is probably true. And yet – I believe that as ethical surgeons we SHOULD try and protect some poorly or uneducated, inexperienced patients from themselves. Afterall, if our children wanted to have a lifelong ill-advised body modification (such as a neck tattoo, slit tongue, nose piercing etc), we knew was wrong would we approve of it? Furthermore, would we as well trained surgeons perform those procedures on them (because times were tough and someone else might otherwise)?<br>
IMPLANT CHOICE IN ADELAIDE</p><p>It is obvious that not all people are created equal and that the breast implants that would look proportionate on a 6’1″ 180 pound woman would look huge and disproportionately “booby” on a 5’1″ 110 pound woman.</p><p>Moreover, implants are NOT static. They change the underlying chest wall and the breast above them by stretching it out. Once large implants are placed in the breast they cannot be exchanged like removeable piece of Leggo without permanent consequences to the breasts.</p><p>(If you doubt it – read the many stories of unhappy breast augmentation stories on this website. Their common denominator was choosing implants that were too large). </p><p>THE IDEAL BREAST IMPLANT depends on education, education, education – you get the point.</p><p>The BEST implant is one that can be covered by YOUR present breast and muscle tissues and remain on your chest (IE not fall off to the side and do battle with your arms).<br>
While much larger implants CAN be physically placed (subject to the physical limitations of the amount of stretchiness and accomodation of your breast skin ), your breasts will never appear natural or attractive.</p><p>Instead, all the implant creases will be visiblean palpable and your breasts will be permanently stretched and thinned out. There is NO one 100% reliable method of picking implants. True. </p><p>But a combination of methods such as using sizers and focusing on the base diameter (IE potential cover) of your current breast WILL offer the most reliable information.</p><p>Pick a Plastic surgeon who will guide you and may disagree with you. You do not want a cash strapped, ethically confused or lacking surgeon doing everything you want without guiding you as to the BEST choice.<br>
<b>Sports Bra after Breast Implants in Adelaide</b></p><p>Every plastic surgeon is different with regard to their post operative bra routine. It is always best to ask your surgeon and follow their instructions. I personally tell my patients to use a non-underwire sports bra or a front closing surgical bra for the first 6 weeks.</p><p>The sports bra will help to reduce swelling and most patients say they have less pain when they have a bra on. The front closing bras are easier to put on for the first few weeks.</p><p>Underwires are not recommended since you don’t want to be putting pressure on the lower pocket of the breast especially if you have an incision in the breast fold. If the implants are under the muscle, you don’t want to wear underwire bras for several months because you don’t want to be pushing the implants any higher.</p><p><b>Do I need a lift?</b></p><p>There is no right or wrong answer. The answer is highly dependent on what you want to accomplish. That is something that you and your plastic surgeon should spend time delineating. After you do that you can discuss the pros and cons of a breast lift/augmentation and augmentation alone.</p><h5>Can Breast Implants poison you if they leak?</h5><p>The short answer is no. Implants used in the US are filled with either saline or silicone- if a saline implant leaks, because saline solution fills our bodies and cells, your body simply absorbs it.</p><p> with a modern silicone implant, the gel would remain contained by the capsule around the implant initially. Over a long period of time, some of the gel may escape the capsule, but this is thought to be more rare with the newer implant designs.</p><p>In either case, the silicone is inert, meaning the body does not react to it at all. There is no such thing as an allergy to the silicone, and a great many scientific studies have now been done over 40 years proving the silicone to be safe- no one believes anymore that they could cause you an illness or complicate an illness you already have.</p><p>The surgery, as with any other, does have risks, but for healthy people these risks are very low and manageable. The key to achieving the outcome you want and enjoying a smooth experience is to choose your surgeon carefully.</p><p>Here is some information on how best to do that</p><p><b>What size implants would give me my desired look/is a lift necessary? </b></p><p>Your anatomy suggests to me that you do not need an uplift but that you need to be aware of the presence of asymmetry and the fact that your breasts will always remain different to some degree even with breast implants placed.</p><p>I would personally place a larger implant on your smaller side as long as you have adequate skin distensability to avoid a tight round look on the smaller breast side than on the opposite.  The ultimate size of your breast implants can best be determined at the time of surgery when sizers are placed and the actual appearance can be seen.</p><p>I would estimate that your implants would be in a size range between 320 and 380 mL but this is just an estimate only. You are definitely not in need of an uplift in my opinion and should have a nice result but realize that achieving a target photograph is only a goal and not a certainty.<br>
<i>Which Breast Implant Placement Gives a More Natural Appearance?</i></p><p>There is no particular breast implant placement in Adelaide which is right for everyone. Implants can be placed either above or behind the pectoralis major muscle. When placed under the muscle, also known as sub-pectoral placement, implants can be either partially or completely under the muscle.</p><p>Partially under the muscle placement can also be performed in a technique called dual plane which improves the shape of the lower pole of the breast in some patients. Implants placed above the muscle are also said to be pre-pectoral or sub-glandular.</p><p>This placement positions the implant above the muscle but behind the breast gland. It’s important to understand that there is no one placement technique which is best in all patients. Some patients will look better with their implants under the muscle and others above.</p><p>Some of the factors which need to be considered include the pre-operative appearance of the breast, degree of breast droopiness (or ptosis) and amount of natural breast tissue. Implant placement which will give the most natural result is determined by a careful examination by your plastic surgeon and a discussion of your lifestyle and desired new look.</p><p>Remember…..looking natural should be your, and your plastic surgeons, most important goal.</p><p><em>Breast implant size</em></p><p> Selection of the implant size in Adelaide is often a source of anxiety around the time of breast augmentation. There are a variety of different volumes and profiles of impanys now available which allows us to customize the surgery more than ever before.</p><p>When it comes to implant selection” it is essential to take a three dimensional approach. Start with the width where the width of the impant should match the base width of your breasts. This will avoid a big space between the breasts as well as the lateral overflow.</p><p>Given your dimensions, it would be important to use and imp,ant that was not too wide. The profile of the implant can then be selected based on the type of look you are hoping to achieve.</p><p>The high profile implant that you reference will create a rounder and fuller look that can sacrifice some of the naturalness. The volume can then be selected based on these two factors. I would suggest discussing your implant choice with your plastic surgeon.</p><p>There are sizing systems that can be used to give you a better idea of your selection. Your surgeon can also discuss your dimensions and the rational behind the impant chosen. </p><p><i>Breast augmentation plastic surgery prices in 2011:</i></p><ul>
