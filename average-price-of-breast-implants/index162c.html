<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Average Breast Implant surgery costs range from $4,000 to $6,500 depending on the style of implant in my San Antonio, TX clinic. Saline cost between $4,000-$4500, Silicone cost $5,000-$5,500 and the new 410 Gel “Gummy Bear” Implant costs $6,500-$7,000. My costs include everything (facility, Board Certified Anesthesiologist, Physician, Garment, and Implants).</p><p>Total costs can vary depending on where you live. Don’t let price be the only factor when deciding on your surgeon. Make sure your Plastic Surgeon is Board Certified in Plastic Surgery.</p><p>I would also recommend looking at their before/after pictures, patient reviews, and asking friends or family who they may recommend from a firsthand experience.</p><p>Lastly, make sure you like your Plastic Surgeon. You need to feel comfortable with the surgeon and trust that they have your best interest in mind. (Bernard Kopchinski, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Implant Average Costs</h3><p>The average cost of breast implants vary often depending on areas of the country. They also commonly vary for the city you live in. My practice is in Las Vegas.</p><p>I charge for a saline breast augmentation $4650 and a silicone breast augmentation $5750. The costs include operating room, implants, surgical fees, labwork and first sports bra. (Stephen M. Miller, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>An augmentation alone can cost between $5-7000, including implants, surgeons fees, OR and anesthesia. (Brian K. Reedy, MD, Reading Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Total cost will vary</h3><p>The total costs will vary based on your surgeon, the geographical location, type of implants, and hospital/ facility/anesthesia fees. In additional, the complexity of your case may sometimes increase the fees as it necessitates longer operative times, ie: if you need a lift or for a revision.</p><p>I would recommend meeting with a board-certified plastic surgeon and getting an accurate quote. (Chia Jen Lynn Chung, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Prices for breast augmentation.</h3><p>The prices for this procedure will very based on some of your implant choices as well as cost that the individual surgeon charges. In Florida the prices also very widely blood for our area the prices are generally in the range of approximately $5000-$6500.</p><p>You would like to seek out a experienced board certified plastic surgeon for these procedures. Check the surgeons credentials and they’re Hospital affiliations.</p><p>You can also check there previous history regarding disciplinary actions. In addition to that check the facilities and the clinic that they work at (John J. O’Brien, Jr., MD, Saint Petersburg Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In general, silicone implants are a bit more expensive than saline breast implants. In my opinion, silicone is a superior product and you get what you pay for. I would counsel you to be wary of the best “deal” on implants.</p><p>Like most things in life, bargain basement prices often mean a sacrifice of quality. When you are talking about a surgical procedure, you are paying for a board certified plastic surgeon, a safe-accredited facility, nursing staffing, state of the art equipment, a board-certified anesthesiologist and a top of the line FDA approved implant.</p><p>Depending on the region of the country, you should expect to pay anywhere from $7,000 to $12,000. (Salvatore Pacella, MD, MBA, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation Pricing</h3><p>The average cost of a Breast Augmentation can vary widely and the smart patient will do their homework. Make sure you ask questions of the office staff when you begin to call around and start the process of finding the appropriate surgeon. Often times the quoted price of an advertisement does not include all of the fees.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_487" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Be certain that the quoted fee includes the surgeon, implant, anesthesia, and facility fees at a minimum. Other fees to be aware of are prescription medications, garment such as a sports bra and other specialty items such as a Keller funnel which your surgeon may use. These can all add up! Once you have the full price in hand, other things to consider when choosing your surgeon is how much he or she charges for revisionary procedures if needed. For example, ask your surgeon or patient coordinator how much it would be out of pocket if you were to develop a complication such as a capsular contracture. Although rare, Its nice to know what you would be expected to pay if such a condition presented itself. (Scot Martin, MD, Las Cruces Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Price for Breast Implants</h3><p>I am assuming you would like to know the total cost for breast implant surgery which includes implants, surgeons fee, anesthesia and facility charge. The prices vary according to the geographic location in the country and the various surgeons. Ranges run from $4000 to over $10,000.</p><p>Gel implants are about $1000 more than saline. Quality and care need not suffer. (Richard Linderman, MD, Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How much do Breast implants cost</h3><p>The cost of breast implants vary by region. The cost is cased on several variables. The surgeon’s fee. the cost of the implants, the facilty fee and the anesthesia fee.</p><p>Not all breast implant operations are the same. Obviously each patient has diferent needs, and the surgery addresses them specifically, such as the need for a lift, the correction of asymmetry, a redo aug, and the use of saline vrs silicone implants.</p><p>One should always seek a board certified surgeon and undergo the procedure in a AAAA certified facility or hospital outpatient department for the utmost of safety. All of these will impact the cost and the outcome. (Beverly Friedlander, MD, Short Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of Breast augmentation</h3><p>Breast augmentation costs between 4500 to 7000 depending on the difficulty of your breasts and whether you want saline or silicone implants.</p><p>Difficult breasts include breasts that are sagging, are asymmetric, or have breast mound deformities. (Arian Mowlavi, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast augmentation costs vary from region to region, and even within a regional marketplace. The cost of any surgical procedure includes the cost of the surgeon’s time (Surgeon’s fee), the cost of supplies (in this case, breast implants), the cost of anesthesia (particularly if general anesthesia and an anesthesiiologist or nurse anesthetist is used) and the costs of the facility in which the surgery is performed.</p><p>In South Florida, breast augmentation (assuming no lift is required) ranges from about $4500-6000. Silicone implants may cost 200-300 dollars more per breast compared to saline implants, mostly reflecting the higher cost charged to the surgeon by the manufacturers.</p><p>Presumably, it costs more to make a silicone gel-filled implant than a saline implant. Simultaneous breast lifting (mastopexy) increases the costs due to added surgeon’s time, added facility OR time, and added anesthesia time.</p><p>This can add another 2000-3000 to the total cost in some cases. There are many types of breast lifts of varying complexity. (Tim A. Sayed, MD, FACS, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How Much Do Breast Implants Cost in San Francisco?</h3><p>The price for breast augmentation varies depending on the location and the doctor’s expertise. Our practice charges $4,000.00 for the surgeon’s fees, and the price for silicone breast implants are $2,000.00 while the price for saline breast implants are nearly $1,000.00 cheaper.</p><p>There will also be additional costs for the operating room and general anesthesia. (Kenneth Bermudez, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of breast implants</h3><p>Like many procedures, fees for breast implant surgery vary a lot depending on the training and reputation of the surgeon, the type of implants used, and one’s geographical location. Typically the total cost for the surgery is going to include a surgeon’s fee, the facility fee, anesthesia fees, implant costs, medications, and any preoperative lab fees. On average the total fee starts at around $5000 for saline implants, and goes up from there.</p><p>Ideally, cost should only be a minor consideration. More importantly, a patient must feel comfortable with the surgeon’s reputation, communication skills, and overall practice environment. (Kelly Gallego, MD, FACS, Yuba City Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of breast implant surgery</h3><p>Across the country the prices for breast implant surgery very quite significantly. Breast augmentation surgery costs have 4 parts, or components. The surgeon’s fee, anesthesiologist’s fee, implants cost, costs of the facility are 4 components of breast implant surgery costs. Depending on physical location, type of the facility and type of the implant used, the costs of saline implant may run from $3600 to $10,000 in some Metropolitan areas. Usually, silicone implant surgery costs runs from $5500 over $12,000 in the same areas. However, on average, saline implant without lift with cost anywhere from $3900 to $5500 and silicone implant surgery will cost between $1500 and $2000 more, or $5700 to $7500.</p><p>It is important to remember to choose a properly trained board certified plastic surgeon for your surgery and make sure that the surgery is performed at a properly accredited or certified facility, like hospital, or outpatient surgery center that is also properly certified and / or licensed. The main licensing agencies that are considered to be credible in this country, are Medicare, JCAHO, AAAHC, and AAAASF. (Boris Volshteyn, MD, MS, East Brunswick Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How much do breast implants cost?</h3><p>This a very common question and really depends on where you are, who your surgeon is and what type of implants your are getting. In the Northeast, where I am, they usually range from $6000 to $9000 and include anesthesia and procedure room.</p><p>Silicone implants are about $1000 more than saline. Price will also be based on experience and demand for a particular surgeon. As with everything, you probably don’t want to go with the cheapest one you can find. You may end up paying more in the long run fixing complications. Find a surgeon that you can trust, who will spend time with you, and give you good advice on what is best for you. If you find you are rushed or being “sold to” then you should probably look elsewhere. (Adam Hamawy, MD, Princeton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The answer depends on which type of implant you choose, the facility charge where you have the surgery, the length of the operation and how much the surgeon charges for his or her fee. It is best to contact several local board certified plastic surgeons to determine what your local fees might be. (Mark Deutsch, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast implant surgery, all inclusive, can typically cost anywhere from $5000 – $10,000. There are surgeons who offer it for less, but cheaper is not better, and finding the best deal is not something I would focus on when choosing a qualified surgeon.</p><p>It is important to understand what is included in the price – there is a surgeon’s fee, anesthesiologist fee, surgery center fee, implant fee, and then any other added expenses which could include labs, mammograms, or an evaluation for surgery by your primary care doctor.</p><p>Please remember that price is only one aspect of cosmetic surgery – finding a qualified, board-certified plastic surgeon who operates in accredited facilities with certified anesthesia providers is very important, as is your overall communication with the surgeon and staff who will be taking care of you from beginning to end. (Michelle A. Spring, MD, FACS, Missoula Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation prices</h3><p>The price for breast augmentation will vary depending on surgeon, experience, and geographic region. Also, silicone implants will cost more than saline implants (but in my opinion totally worth the added cost).</p><p>You should expect to spend about $8,000 to $10,000 in NYC. Obviously the prices can be cheaper other places and I am perplexed about some of the ridiculously low prices that are advertised here. If it sounds too good to be true.. (Matthew Schulman, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation Cost</h3><p>Breast augmentation in the state of Florida varies by geographic location. In the Tampa Bay region, the general cost of breast augmention is between $5,000 to $6,500.</p><p>This includes the cost of surgery, anesthesia and operating room. (Jeremy A. Benedetti, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Implant Cost</h3><p>Everyone tends to “beat around the bush” when you ask a question about the cost of various plastic surgery procedures. Now you can find a doctor in your area, choose your procedure of interest and see a breakdown of all of the costs: surgeon’s fee, OR/anesthesia fees, implant cost, cosmetic insurance coverage, postop garments. For accurate pricing information from a specific doctor in your area, click on the web reference link below to determine pricing for breast augmentation. You’ll thank me later! (Jonathan Kaplan, MD, MPH, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Advice re cost of breast implants</h3><p>Please, please, please do your research, ensure your surgeon is fully accredited and insured in the country that you are in.</p><p>Read reviews, and ask to speak to other patients, which is far better than just looking at an album of someone’s best results! Costs will vary like anything based on multiple factors including location, cost of implants, hospital Costs, anaesthetist costs, daycase or overnight. In the UK, in my practice the costs of breast augmentation varies from 4295-5495. (Sultan Hassan, MD, FRCS(Plast), London Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of Breasts Implants</h3><p>The cost of breast implants depend on what type of implant your getting either saline or silicone. Saline implants are cheaper then silicone.</p><p>Our office charges $5250 for saline that price includes everything your surgical fee, implants, facility fee, and post op care.</p><p>For silicone its $6050 and again that includes everything. (Fereydoon S. Mahjouri, MD, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breasts Augmentation Costs</h3><p>The total fee for Breast Augmentation at Finkle Cosmetic Surgery Center is $4,700 for saline and $5,700 for silicone. This is an all inclusive fee which includes surgeon’s fee, anesthesia, facility and implants.</p><p>We have placed over 10,000 cosmetic breast implants and all procedures are performed in our private, modern outpatient surgery suite. Our operating suite is nationally accredited, state licensed, with board certified anesthesia and all ACLS trained nurses.</p><p>This is the most frequent procedure we perform, and have been featured on Reality TV on MTV’s Teen Mom and USMagazine has honored us as one of the top plastic surgery procedures performed in 2011. We offer a fly in program and can offer a virtual on line consultation.</p><p>Omaha is centrally located and has a busy airport with multiple flights available which keeps air fares reasonable, contact us for further information (David Finkle, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breasts augmentation cost</h3><p>Breast augmentation cost has four components:</p><ul>
<li>implant costs (silicone implants themselves cost about twice that of silicone)</li>
<li>surgeon fees</li>
<li>operating room fees</li>
<li>anesthesia fees</li>
</ul><p>The total varies from surgeon to surgeon and from one area of the country to another.</p><p>It can range greatly from 4000 to 12,000 but most silicone breast augmentations performed by a board certified plastic surgeon will be about 6,000.  (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How much does breast augmentation cost?</h3><p>This varies significantly from region to region and from practice to practice. When considering plastic surgery, it is not the time for “bargain-shopping”, but the most expensive doesn’t mean “the best” either.</p><p>Call around to plastic surgeons in you area to get the range of costs, then meet with several and use the one that makes you the most comfortable in all aspects. not just cost. (Dustin L. Reid, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Depends for our breast augmentation patients, the actual surgery to place the implants costs the same no matter if the patient desires saline or silicone implants. however, the costs of the implants themselves differ by about 1000.</p><p>The cost of silicone implants is higher given the amount of R&D as well as FDA work the implant manufacturers spent to get the implants back on the market. (Eric Chang, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of breasts implants in Albany, NY</h3><p>As noted by others, the cost of breast augmentation can vary greatly depending on where you live and what the top surgeons in your area charge their patients. Besides the surgeon’s fee, the biggest contributors to price are the type of implants used, where the surgery is performed and anesthesiologist’s fee.</p><p>That said, more important than cost is finding a surgeon that is not only experienced in all types of breasts, since they vary greatly, but also one that is highly recommended and can show you many before and after photos of cases similar to your own.</p><p>For those interested in a bit more detail, Dr. Aldea’s answer provides terrific insight and is certainly worth reading.</p><p>The surgeon should of course be board certified in plastic surgery, especially given the confusion caused by the influx of MDs trained in other disciplines now attempting to perform this and other cosmetic procedures.</p><p>In the Albany NY area, the cost of a straight forward augmentation ranges between $5,000-7,500 depending on the type of implants used and the reputation and experience of the surgeon.
