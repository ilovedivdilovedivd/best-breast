<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><b>Breast implant appearance over time</b></p><p>After a breast lift/augmentation in Boston procedure the skin is tightened and volume is added to the breast to create a fuller and more youthfully shaped breast. Initially, postoperative swelling and tight skin obscures the final expected result which comes many months later after skin and muscle has had an opportunity to relax.</p><p>I think it would be reasonable to anticipate that results will change after the first few months and that volume will likely become less than initial postoperative result due to swelling. I would certainly recommend getting through the complete postoperative recovery period prior to considering any change in size or revisional operations.</p><p>it does appear that you would benefit from a lift. Generally,if your nipple level is at or below the level of your inframammary fold, a lit will be required irrespective of whether or not implants are placed.</p><p>Its seems that you are an excellent candidate for breast augmentation. I understand your fear of loving the breast you have, and just wanting to go larger-without ruining what you have.</p><p>Plastic surgery is an art and a science. You should choose your surgeon carefully, to help ensure you get the results you want and deserve with no complications. If you are unhappy for whatever reason, it is possible to remove your implants.</p><p>I have had patients remove their implants, for various reasons (unhappy with larger breast, change of heart, partners did not care for them) and their breast returned to the pre operative state with little to no lasting effects.</p><p>A breast augmentation doesn’t simply had you a new set of breast. You will have a larger version of what you previous had. Your breast are ideal for a breast augmentation candidate. I feel that you will have beautiful results.</p><p>Your breast, just larger.. Make sure to consult a board certified plastic surgeon in person before making your final choices.</p><p><i>NON-Surgical Breast Augmentation</i></p><p>The recurrent horror stories fed to us by the media deter a lot of women from having a Breast Augmentation. While Breast Augmentation, like ALL operations, has potential complications, the vast majority of women who had the operation would NOT willingly part with their implants.</p><p>As regards NON-Surgical Breast Augmentation – For many years, many methods have been tried with mostly minimal success and major disappointment. You can still see a suction vacuum breast “augmentation” device the the OLD Sears catalog.</p><p>The possibility of using stem cells and fat grafting to augment breasts is attractive but is very much still in the trial and error stage and most Plastic surgeons prefer to see what are its limitations before offering it to their patients.</p><p>As regards Natural Remedies, for the most part they do not work. But then, why would flooding your body with mega doses of female hormones be regarded as safe or “natural”?? High doses of female hormones are associated with higher risk of uterine cancer, blood clots and many other complications.</p><p>At this point in time, your BEST option still remains Breast Implants.</p><h3>Breast implants and pregnancy</h3><p>Pregnancy can affect the breast in many ways, regardless of whether the patient has had breast implants or not. A high percentage of my patients have breast implants placed prior to pregnancy and remain happy with their results after pregnancy.</p><p>Nonetheless breast changes after pregnancy can result in breast enlargement, loss of breast volume, or sagging of the breasts. In some cases a mastopexy, or breast lift, is desired if there is significant sagging of the breasts after pregnancy.</p><p>Having breast implants placed before pregnancy is also safe, and only in rare cases will this affect the ability to breast feed. This is something that you can discuss with your surgeon prior to surgery, as some surgical techniques carry lower risks.</p><p><strong>Breast implant exchange through the arm pit incision </strong></p><p>It is possible to perform a breast implant exchange through the arm pit incision. In the past, we have been limited as to the size of silicone breast implant that could be placed through the arm pit incision.</p><p>However, in our practice with specific techniques, we have successfully placed silicone breast implants through the armpit incision of sizes up to 500 cc’s. This can be a tricky procedure so it is essential that you only work with a board-certified plastic surgeon who has a great deal of experience with breast augmentation and specifically the trans-axillary approach.</p><p>To learn more about breast augmentation, see photos, and help you decide which one is best for you, please visit us at the link below</p><p><strong>Breast Augmentation after weightloss</strong></p><p>Your breasts used to be significantly larger before your weight-loss. Therefore, there is a reasonable chance that with placement of implants alone, there will be some increased stretch of the breast skin and tissues, positioning them lower.</p><p>It seems that you have well positioned areolas to consider a periareolar lift and avoid the vertical scar. Both options may be available to you, that is either breast augmentation alone or augmentation combined with a breastlift.</p><p>It would benefit you to be seen in person to have the laxity of your skin evaluated before formulating a surgical plan.</p><h3>Large implant vs Lift</h3><p>Looking at your photos, you have the most severe category of breast ptosis or droop as your nipples are pointing down, plus you also have significant loss of volume. The only way to correct this is with a breast lift.</p><p>If you tried to fill or lift the breast with only a very large implant, it can actually look worse, as the implant and breast tissue will not sit in the same position. Your breasts will still be very droopy and the nipples will still point down.</p><p>I would say you need a breast lift with an implant.</p><p><em>Can breast implants be done post reduction mammoplasty?</em></p><p>Breast augmentation can definitely be performed after breast reduction surgery. Weight loss and loss of breast volume are common reasons for patients to require implants to improve breast fullness. Consult with your local plastic surgeons to find out if you are a good candidate for surgery.</p><p><i>Financing Breast Implants Boston</i></p><p>In Boston breast implant surgery financing can be obtained through Medicard or Credit Medical. These are two very reputable companies that specialise in the financing of cosmetic surgery. Unlike Care Credit they do not generally charge a fee to the doctor so almost all plastic surgeons, including myself, will work with them and will even help patients with the credit application process.</p><h3>Breast augmentation incisions</h3><p>Your incisions for breast augmentation depend on your examination. The most common incident is a crease incision. The periareolar incision depends on the diameter of the areolar. Not everyone is a candidate for that incision.</p><p>Please have several consults with board certified plastic surgeons to determine the best approach for your augmentation .</p><p><b>What breast implants to use</b></p><p>The decision on what breast implants to use should always be a collaborative effort between the physician and the patient. It should never be one sided. During my consultation I listen the the patients desires.</p><p>We than perform a 3D body scan where the implant size, style and shape can be manipulated. In this process the patient can determine what size she thinks she may want choose. Next step is we show the patient the actual implant to try on and confirm her choice.</p><p>This is an interactive process but if I think the patient is making a mistake it is my duty as a physician to voice my opinion and concerns. The patient can certainly insist on a size.</p><p>However, the physician can certainly refuse to do the procedure as well. Make sure you have surgery by a board certified plastic surgeon that you like and respect.</p><p><i>Uneven Breasts</i></p><p>First of all, you should know that every woman has asymmetrical breasts to some extent. Surgery can definitely help them look more even, although you’re wise to understand that “perfectly even” isn’t a realistic expectation.</p><p>There are a lot of different breast enhancement procedures that can help your breasts look more symmetrical. If you want to go larger on both sides, one implant can be smaller than the other to compensate for the breast that’s naturally larger.</p><p>If you’re happy with the natural size of the larger breast, then only one implant could be used. A surgeon could also perform a breast reduction to reduce the larger breast down to the size of the smaller breast.</p><p>Finally, a breast lift can help ensure that the position and placement of both breasts is as close to even as possible.</p><p><em>No expiration date on breast implants</em></p><p>There is no expiration date on implants so it is hard to say when or if they will ever need to be replaced. As long as you have no signs of deflation, capsular contracture, or any other problematic issues with your breasts, they may never need to be replaced.</p><p>It is important, especially if you have silicone implants, to get a regular mammogram or MRI to make sure everything is ok. Other than that, if you are not experiencing any problems with the implant, and they still look good to you as time passes by, then there is no need to replace them.</p><p>Insurance will usually not cover the implant replacement procedure as it is usually determined to be cosmetic. However, most implants come with a warranty, so the cost of the implant might be covered if the implant is leaking.</p><p><strong>There are benefits to both placements</strong></p><p>There isn’t one placement that’s better than the other, only which placement will be better to help meet your personal goals for breast augmentation in Boston. Many women and their surgeons swear by subglandular placement for a naturally full look and enhanced cleavage.</p><p>Implant placement below the muscle means added support for the implant, which can help ensure longer-lasting results with less sagging over time. Most importantly, your friend’s results are not your results. Every woman’s anatomy is different, each surgery is performed differently and the outcome of your breast augmentation will be different too.</p><p>If you choose Boston silicone implants under the muscle, there is very little chance you’ll see rippling after surgery in Boston.</p><h5>Underwire Bras after Breast Implant Surgery</h5><p>After breast enlargement surgery has been completed and breast implants settled in their new position, there are no contraindications to wearing underwire bra. Immediately after breast augmentation surgery the implants need to settle. They usually settle in a downward direction.</p><p>That is why a lot of plastic surgeons use special push down dressings to prevent the breast implants from riding up upwards. Wearing underwire bra prior to 6-12 weeks, or before breast implants settle in their final position, may encourage the implants to migrate upward and end up in unnatural positition.</p><p>In some patients, when breast implant surgery is performed through inframammary incision, the scar may be sensitive. If underwire bra is located at the level, it may be uncomfortable for the patient. However, in time, the sensitivity usually decreases myself, or occasionally with silicone gel application, or steroid injections.</p><h4>The risks of breast implants in Boston are modest.</h4><p>In the short term after their placements, the risk of infection and hematoma (bleeding) exist but extremely uncommon. Infection is &lt;1% and hematoma rate about 2% (and is easily treatable. Long term, 2 significant issues. Capsular contracture (hardening) of the breasts which is not a health problem but compromises the aesthetic result.</p><p>The incidence is reporter from &lt;1% to 17%. I think the real number is somewhere around 4 to 5% where the capsule is significant enough that both patient and surgeon would agree that something should be done about the problem.</p><p>Implants can fail. This is not dangerous but requires replacement (another operation). This is not an emergency silicone or saline. It is done at the patient’s convenience. The failure rate is &lt;2% in the first 10 years.</p><p>After that we don’t know.</p><p><em>What do Breast implants feel like</em></p><p>Boston breast implants can feel very natural. The more natural breast tissue you have, the less likely you are able to feel the implants, particularly the Silicone implants. It is not uncommon to feel some “rippling” or surface irregularity with Saline implants on the sides, if the implants are behind the muscle.</p><p>This rippling may be visible if you are very thin and/or the Saline implants are on top of the muscle. The saline implants feel more firm than the silicone implants , but neither one feels hard unless scar tissue has developed around them, a condition called capsular contracture.</p><p><strong>Armpit Incision Best for Breast Augmentation</strong></p><p>Your question is a good one and one that I deal with daily in my practice. While you certainly have a choice of where you want the incision made for your breast augmentation, there are always better choices and not so better choices.</p><p>If I were you, I would like to hear the surgeon’s preference as opposed to a politically correct answer. So here goes. I have been putting breast implants in through the armpit since the early 1990’s.</p><p>This incision heals best of all choices because it follows what is known as Langer’s Lines which none of the other incisions do. This leads to often an invisible or almost invisible scar. Also, no one, not even your mother, has intentionally looked in your armpit.</p><p>Incisions under the breast or around the areolar leave a visible scar, even in the best of circumstances which can cause embarrassment in the future. The belly button incision most Board Certified plastic surgeons believe is a bad joke, and at best, one can only put in saline implants which in my opinion are far inferior to today’s silicone implant choices.</p><p>Incisions in the armpit can be very short, often not more than an 1-1/2″ long, even using large implants if one uses the Keller funnel. This operating tool also allows the surgeon to not drag skin bacteria into the implant pocket, therefore decreasing the chance of hard breasts.</p><p>I do all my armpit or axillary breast augmentations using an endoscope which allows much more control over potential bleeding and a more perfect pocket creation than when not using one. I believe you have three reasonable choices: periareolar (around areolar), inframammary (the crease beneath the breast), and axillary (armpit).</p><p>As you can tell, my preference would be the armpit.</p><h3>Will high profile implants give “natural-looking” breasts?</h3><p>This is an excellent question and one that I’m asked everyday about implant profiles. According to your measurements you have a small frame and want to go up by two cup sizes. I agree that a high profile implant of 500cc will give you a very rounded, augmented appearance to your breasts.</p><p>My concern with you is that you want a DD cup size but still retain a “natural look”. Since you have a smaller frame, and want a large cup size, it its often difficult to make a large implant look natural.</p><p>I disagree with your PS that a high profile implant will give you a “nice” and natural look. It will give you a large, rounded appearance to your breasts. You need to have an honest discussion with your PS and show him pictures of what you want to look like and what you do not want to look like.</p><h4>High Profile Implants To Correct Drooping?</h4><p>I have to agree with most of what has already been said. Higher profile implants do tend to look more round and more fake. If you want to be much larger, then you would probably need a high profile implant to get a large volume implant to fit on your chest, but to use one only for the purpose of lifting would not be my recommendation.</p><p>I have seen many patients who have had excessively large implants placed at the recommendation of their surgeon to try to correct drooping and avoid scars. This is a bad plan! I do a lot of secondary breast surgery on patients who complain that their breasts are too large or fake looking.<br>
