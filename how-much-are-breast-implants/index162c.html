If you opt for the “gummy bear” implants, this can add another $500 to $1000. (Suzanne M. Quardt, MD, Palm Springs Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of Breast Implants Varies</h3><p>The cost of breast implants varies, depending on surgeon expertise, where the surgeon is located, and the type of implant used (saline versus silicone, round versus anatomic).</p><p>The total cost typically includes the surgeon’s fees, the anesthesia fees, and the surgery center fees. In the Dallas area, the total fees may range from $5000-$7500.</p><p>Although cost is a factor in every patient’s decision, I would caution anyone from making a decision based solely on cost.</p><p>Make sure your doctor is a board certified plastic surgeon who understands your needs and concerns. (Farah Naz Khan, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Implant Cost</h3><p>You are not alone in asking about it because it is a great way to improve how you look and feel about yourself! It takes about an hour and is an outpatient procedure which means you go home the same day.</p><p>There is some discomfort for the first week and you look great immediately! Before you know it, you will love how you fit in clothing and bathing-suits!</p><p>We can perform 3D imaging in the office at your consultation to get an idea of what you will look like after the procedure.</p><p>A breast augmentation, including the OR fee, Anesthesia, and all my care is $4,812 for a saline augmentation and a bit more for silicone. (K. Roxanne Grawe, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implant costs</h3><p>The cost of breast augmentation in Toronto ranges between $7000-9000 depending on the type of implant used. The cost you are quoted by a surgeon should include the following:</p><ul>
<li>Surgeon fees-OR rental and supplies</li>
<li>Anesthesia care</li>
<li>Nursing</li>
<li>Implant cost</li>
<li>Follow up care</li>
</ul><p>The price differential is predominantly due to the prices of the implants themselves. Saline implants are approximately $1000 less expensive than cohesive gel implants, and shaped implants are about $600 more expensive. Its important to talk to your surgeon about the cost of surgery and what is included. (Kunaal Jindal, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of Breast Implants</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_498" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The cost of breast augmentation can vary a great deal in a given community. Be sure that cost is not your primary reason for choosing a plastic surgeon. That being said some doctors will list their prices online and most will give the information over the phone assuming you don’t need a lift or additional procedures. (Bradley A. Hubbard, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation</h3><p>While cost is an important question to ask, it is even more important to make sure your doctor is a board certified plastic surgeon who specializes in breast augmentation surgery. Look at before and after photos of patients on whom the doctor has performed breast augmentation and speak with patients who have had a breast augmentation performed by that doctor.</p><p>Once you choose a doctor with whom you feel comfortable and whose results you like, I suggest using computer imaging (e.g., VECTRA) to assist with size selection. After you have done this, then I recommend focusing on costs. Be sure to accurately compare price estimates asking about all fees (e.g., surgeon, implants, garments, facility/operating room, recovery, anesthesia). (Adam Schaffner, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of breast implants varies depending on a number of considerations.</h3><p>There are many different factors that affect the total cost of your breast implants, including whether you choose saline, silicone or gummy bear implants and whether additional procedures (such as a breast lift) are included at the same time. Your surgeon’s fee will vary by region and practice, and you’ll also be paying for your anesthesiologist and the surgical facility.</p><p>RealSelf puts the average cost for breast implants in Newport Beach (where my practice is located) at $5750, which is just under the U.S. average of $6075. However, don’t forget to look at the big picture when comparing surgeons and prices, as choosing the safest and most skilled surgeon for your breast augmentation should take priority over the biggest savings. (Nirav Savalia, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In most cases, in our area a breast augmentation without any additional procedures is around six thousand dollars. When price comparing, make sure to know procedure cost, facility cost and anesthesia costs.</p><p>The only cost difference that you will be able to decide is the type of implant used. You can choose saline filed, silecone gel filled, or a shaped implant. Gel filled implans are definatly worth the added expense over saline! (Stephan Finical, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Saline Breast implant prices</h3><p>Around the country, the total cost of breast augmentation falls between $4,000 and $10,000. Doctors commonly charge about $1,000 more for silicone gel implants than for saline implants.</p><p>That’s because silicone gel implants are more expensive to produce, and manufacturers pass that cost along to doctors, who pass it along to patients. It’s always wise to ask if the price includes the facility, anesthesia, lab tests and all follow-up care. (Ted Eisenberg, DO, Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of breast augmentation</h3><p>Breast augmentation surgery can remain affordable even in a big city like Chicago !our fees are $ 6910 which include the surgeon’s fees, cost of a pair of silicone gel implants, and OR and anesthesia in a downtown hospital.</p><p>You can stay overnight in a private room and nursing care for an additional $ 650 payable to the hospital. (Florence Mussat, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost Considerations</h3><p>Fees vary in different regions of the country. The larger city areas tend to be more costly because the expenses to the surgeon and hospital or ambulatory surgical centers are higher. Make sure that you include the implant fee, the surgeon fee, the anesthesia fee, and the hospital/surgicenter fee when you compare physicians and their fees.</p><p>A good rule of thumb for purchasing almost anything, and it is true with saline breast implants, is don’t go to the cheapest and don’t go to the most expensive. You will find that the reasonable fees will not differ much from each other. Then just choose the physician with whom you feel most comfortable.</p><p>Also make sure you go to a board-certified plastic surgeon. I can guarantee you that those surgeons who are not board-certified plastic surgeons will be cheaper, and remember those old words of wisdom: “You get what you pay for!” (Louis C. Cutolo, Jr., MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How much do saline breast implants cost?</h3><p>A breast augmentation in the Dallas area will range from $4000 to $9500. Several factors can affect the price of the procedure including the type of implant (saline vs silicone vs form staple implants), anesthesia, surgeon’s fee, and surgery center fee.</p><p>The cheapest implant will be the saline followed by silicone and then the form stable or “gummy bear” implant. If a surgeon is willing to give a patient a discount, this will usually be taken from the surgeon’s fee since the anesthesia and facility fee are fixed. I recommend visiting with a board certified plastic surgeon if you have further questions about a breast augmentation. (Robert Najera, MD, Frisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Saline Breast Implants Cost</h3><p>There are certain things that go into the the pricing of the whole surgery there is the cost of the implants, the fee’s for anesthesiologist, nurses, medical supplies, etc. These are some of the elements that contribute to the ultimate cost for a breast augmentation, all in all the surgery could range between 3,100 to 4,200 dlls. (Luis Suarez, MD, Mexico Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Saline breast implant cost typically vary by region. The type of implant selected will impact the cost significantly.Saline implants are the least expensive implants available. Gel implants will be more expensive. Don’t let cost alone be your only criteria in selecting a surgeon. (Jon E. Rast, MD, Kansas City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The fees for this operation vary depending on what type of implant is used, and which physician you choose. We offer a number of different price points, based on the experience of the surgeons, ranging from the resident physicians, to the aesthetic fellows, to surgeons with over 15 years experience.</p><p>We also offer financing through CareCredit. (Anne Taylor, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of breast implants can vary based on what type of implant is used. Many women choose silicone implants which are more expensive.</p><p>On average the total cost of breast implant surgery, done in a major hospital, in my practice is between $6400 and $7500. (Renee Comizio, MD, Morristown Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of silicone implants is only one factor</h3><p>Although cost is always a factor. You need to also consider the skill of the surgeon, Are they a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon, who has been trained for years and examined to confirm their level of expertise. Having a breast augmentation is not like buying a car.</p><p>You can get the exact same car from multiple dealers so price is a big part of your decision on where to buy. With breast augmentation the cost of the implant is only a small part of the surgery fee. You are paying for the skill of the surgeon and there expertise and after care.</p><p>Be careful of shopping just based on price. As it often costs a lot more to fix a bad outcome that it they money you save. (Raymond Jean, MD, Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How much do silicone breast implants cost?</h3><p>The cost of a breast augmentation usually includes a quote that includes the price of the breast implants.</p><p>Saline implants are less expensive than silicone gel implants, but saline implants are associated with a higher rate of implant failure and a higher rate of forming surface ripples that can be seen through the skin.</p><p>For the several hundred dollars difference between the two, I believe the long term advantages of the silicone implants outweigh the additional cost.</p><p>The total cost of an augmentation in my practice runs between $6,000 -$7,000. (John Zavell, MD, FACS, Toledo Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of breast augmentation can vary depending on whether you have saline or silicone implants. There are some important questions to ask as you should not base your decision about where to have surgery only on price. It is important to ask the right questions during your consultation:</p><ol>
<li>Is your surgeon a board certified plastic surgeon?<br>
<strong>a.</strong> Be sure he or she is a plastic surgeon, there are a lot surgeons that are cosmetic surgeons or board certified in other fields other than plastic surgery. They do not do the same training as a plastic surgeon.<br>
<strong>b.</strong> You can check the American Board of Plastic Surgery website for a list of plastic surgeons in your area.</li>
<li>Does your surgeon commonly perform this procedure?a.Ask to see before and after pictures or look online for reviews on the procedure.</li>
<li>Where is the surgery performeda.Is the procedure performed in an accredited surgery center or hospital?</li>
<li>Who performs the anesthesia for the procedure?a.Is an anesthesiologist performing the anesthesia? I hope this helps. (Johnny Franco, MD, Georgetown Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><p>So much depends on your location (prices vary by market), what type of implants you and your doctor choose and if anything besides placing implants needs to be done. For gel implants in our area, Washington DC and surrounds.</p><p>The price ranges from 6-8 thousand dollars all included. My suggestion is not to shop just for price but to choose a surgeon with experience, happy patients and someone you relate to. (A. Dean Jabs, MD, PhD, FACS, Bethesda Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How Much do silicone breast implants Cost?</h3><p>One of the best places to find the cost of any cosmetic procedure is right here on RealSelf. </p><p>If you do a search for the procedure at the top of the RealSelf page and your area or city plus the word cost you will come to a page that has the costs that people have paid for that procedure in your area. It varies from region to region and from city to city largely because of overhead costs and other factors.Another resource is the American Society of Plastic Surgeons web site. (Brian Windle, MD, Kirkland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What does breast augmentation cost?</h3><p>The simple answer is anywhere from $4500-6500 in my practice, depending on the type of implants used. The answer may not always be that easy however, because a good result may entail more than augmentation alone. While there will be outliers on either end of the cost curve, cost alone should not be the determining factor. You need to be comfortable with your surgeon and be sure that they are able to give you what you desire. What may be an extra few hundred dollars will be worth it in the end. (Earl E. Ferguson III, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Price of breast implants</h3><p>Breast augmentation price includes the surgeon’s fee, facility, anaesthesia and the implant cost – saline or silicone.</p><p>Breast augmentation with saline implants cost generally about $6000 and with silicone implants about $7500 for all the parts I mentioned above.</p><p>Be mindful that when you call different offices you may only be quoted the surgeon’s fee which may sound really low until you actually go in for a consultation – so always ask what the quoted fee includes.</p><p>Any significantly low price in your area should raise a red flag about the qualifications of the surgeon – make sure they are board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery and have privileges to perform breast augmentation at a respected local hospital.</p><p>Those two questions are the most important so that you can eventually compare apples to apples. (Bahram Ghaderi, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation Prices</h3><p>Prices vary from state to state. Breast Augmentation in your area averages from $5000 for Saline and $7000 and up for Silicone.</p><p>In Miami, prices average around $2500 for Saline and $3200 for Silicone. Also, choosing bigger implants will not affect the cost of the surgery. (Mel T. Ortega, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Average price Of A Breast Augmentation</h3><p>A straight-forward breast augmentation, not requiring a dual plane mastopexy and not requiring liposuction of axillary breast or a true lift, should cost in the neighborhood of $6,800 – $8,500 in Hawaii.</p><p>The tax and anesthesia are extra. Choosing a Board Certified plastic surgeon with years of experience in breast augmentations reduces the chances of a redo, and therefore lessens the overall potential cost.</p><p>Therefore, selecting the right plastic surgeon can cost you less money in the long run. Board certification by the American Board of Plastic Surgery means the surgeon has been tested by his or her professors and they allowed him or her to sit for the Boards because the professors deem them safe to do plastic surgery.</p><p>Plastic surgery, and especially breast augmentation, requires an eye, a hand, and a heart. By that I mean, the eye implies artistic understanding of what looks good.</p><p>The hand implies technical ability to accomplish what the artistic eye requires. The heart means the surgeon truly cares, not only about the technical outcome, but about the patient’s satisfaction. The cost of a breast augmentation has to be balanced with the quality of the outcome. Choose your plastic surgeon well. If you do, he or she will be worth the cost. (S. Larry Schlesinger, MD, FACS, Honolulu Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Average price of breast implants Montreal</h3><p>The cost of this procedure is quite variable across Canada and even within a large city like Montreal. Breast implants can cost from $5000.00 – $10,000.00, including all fees and taxes, depending on the choice of saline vs. silicone gel, hospital setting vs. private clinic and of course the experience of the surgeon. Some clinics, including ours, offer financing plans. (Arie Benchetrit, MD, Montreal Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Average price of Breast Augmentation in Newport Beach will vary</h3><p>Average price of breast implants in Newport Beach will vary. You can find pricing varying from $3000 to $9000 for saline implants and $4000 to $10,000 for silicone implants.</p><p>There are so many variables that will determine the costs. Some of the things you should consider before choosing your plastic surgeon is:</p><ol>
<li>Is your surgeon a board-certified plastic surgeon, certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery (ABPS.org or ABMS.org)</li>
<li>Is your procedure being performed in an accredited operating suite?</li>
<li>Is your procedure being performed by an anesthesiologist or a nurse anesthetist? This should help you narrow your search.</li>
</ol><p>Following this, you will still find that costs will vary. Every surgeon has determined what they feel is appropriate for their expertise and time performing this procedure and taking care of you following the procedure. Go in for several consultations and determine who you are most comfortable with and then make your choice. (Sanjay Grover, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It depends on the surgeon and where you have the procedure done. Different areas of the country vary in terms of the surgeon fee as well as the facility fee. It also depends if you get silicone or saline implants or the newly approved shaped silicone implants.</p><p>The shaped implants are the most expensive and the saline are the least expensive. Definitely be wary of costs that seem to be a bargain.</p><p>Remember that Breast Augmentation is surgery. Would you pick your heart surgeon because he or she was the least expensive? I hope not! (Ellen A. Janetzke, MD, Birmingham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Newport Beach breast augmentation cost from $5050 (saline) to $7500 (silicone)</h3><p>Average price of breast implants varies according to the type of implant used, as well as the zip code in which the operation is scheduled. While it may be tempting to choose the cheapest price, consider carefully all the components. The surgical package usually includes the surgeon’s fee, facility fee, implants and anesthesia.</p><p>“Hidden” costs such as labwork, medications etc. can add up, especially if you don’t have health insurance to cover prescriptions. Be an informed consumer and consult 2-3 Board Certified Plastic Surgeons in your area before deciding. Breast implants are a life-time commitment. The average woman will have 1-2 other surgeries related to their implants, because of deflation, size change, breast lifts, etc. These subsequent surgeries can be facilitated by having an excellent first operation. In my Newport Beach based practice, the surgical package and post op visits for first time breast augmentation ranges from $5050 (saline) to $7500 (silicone).</p><p>Good luck, but don’t be pennies-wise and compromise your health.
