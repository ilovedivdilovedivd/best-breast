<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Breast augmentation is the most popular cosmetic surgery in Brisbane, AU because it allows women to effectively get consistent beautiful results.</p><p>The surgery itself does not take very long and can be done in women with certain medical conditions, such as SVT.</p><p>The most important factor is to receive an evaluation by your medical doctor or cardiologist to ensure that your SVT is being appropriately treated. You should then only work with a board-certified plastic surgeon who has a great deal of experience in breast augmentation surgery.</p><p>Inform your plastic surgeon of your medical condition as this may change the setting in which they recommend to do the surgery. Also let the anesthesiologist now so that they are aware and can modify your anesthesia is necessary.</p><p>To learn more about breast augmentation in Brisbane, see photos, and help you decide which one is best for you, please visit us at the link below</p><h4>Implants or Lift? Not too Big!</h4><p>When I have patients that are concerned about being too large or are happy with their size and just need lifting, I am hesitant to talk about implants. Some others recommend this but I dont see it as a long term solution for breast aesthetics when the breast is in a low position.</p><p>Brisbane implants can restore the upper pole loss, but the ones you are mentioning will not do this. you would benefit from lifting the breast with perhaps some fat grafting to restore some upper pole fullness as well balance the two breasts in volume.</p><p>I would continue to get information before making your final decision. .</p><p><strong>To lift or not</strong></p><p>Many surgeons try to avoid a lift whenever they can because it is a simpler procedure. In my opinion, a vertical lift is indeed necessary in your case. Avoid going with large implants. In your case 350 would be plenty in addition to the lift.</p><h5>I Have Seen 3 Different Board Certified Plastic Surgeons Regarding Breast Augmentation, and Gotten 3 Opinions?</h5><p>Very hard to address over the internet and you have added your personal restrictions. With all that in mind I recommend a staged operative event. Stage I is placement of implant, in any position (over, under, dual plane, sub facial) as long as the inferior position and pocket is open enough to prevent double bubble effect.</p><p>Than after 3 months a lift if needed. This in my opinion ONLY way to allow you the opportunity to have no lifting possibility.</p><p><strong>Hesitant before an augmentation </strong></p><p>You are a good candidate for an augmentation in Brisbane with either in the implant or even possibly fat grafting. In general your breast will return to their pre-surgical shape after an implant is removed but this may not be true if you encounter serious complications such as an infection or your implant is large enough.</p><p>Given your hesitancy I’d suggest another visit to your surgeon to answer your questions and a little soul searching. .</p><p><b>Brisbane Breast implant size selection</b></p><p>Your concern about size is one of the chief areas of focus for both surgeons and women planning breast augmentation. Many women want to be as large as they can without appearing “fake.” The size implant you choose depends, in my opinion, on four main factors:</p><ol>
<li>What you want to look like</li>
<li>The available breast skin envelope to accomodate the implant</li>
<li>Your pre-existing breast volume, and</li>
<li>The base width of your breast.</li>
</ol><p>Your surgeon should narrow your choices down based on the above, allowing you to select the final size based on your subjective idea of what you believe to be beautiful, and what will best meet your needs.</p><p>The profile you decide upon can be chosen with the assistance of trying on implants in a non-padded bra with a tight T-shirt, and using available surgical simulation technology in many plastic surgeon’s offices, such as the Axis Three Portrait.</p><p>The greater percentage of your final breast that is implant, the less “natural” it will be… not necessarily a bad thing, but something to take into account.</p><p><i>Brisbane Breast implants in petite women</i></p><p>My favorite word when it comes to breast augmentation is proportion. When we do measurements, one of the main factors is base width of your current breast. This serves as a guideline to the selection of cc.</p><p>I also suggest that the patient bring in photos that she likes. This helps us get on the same page. Then we can make determinations as how much projection we need to accomplish the goal.</p><p>This is were projection and choice of projection of the implant comes in. I typically bring in three sizes per patient in the OR. There is dynamic interaction between chest wall, breast tissue and implant.</p><h5>Hidden scars in breast augmentation</h5><p>Placement of incisions for breast augmentation is a personal choice which you make after consultation with your plastic surgeon. The 3 most common areas to place the incisions are:</p><p>1) <b>In the fold under the breast</b>: this allows easy access to create a pocket for the implant, either just under the breast or under the muscle which is below the breast.</p><p>Choosing this incision location has a high degree of safety as there is very good visualization of the entire pocket and the edge of the muscle which may need dividing to get the implant to sit in the correct position.</p><p>The length of the incision depends on whether you choose saline implants ( the incision can be shorter as saline implants come fully deflated and are filled once inside the body) or silicone implants (Brisbane silicone implants are already filled and require a slightly longer incision to get the volume through the opening).</p><p>As the incision is directly in the fold beneath the breast, the incision is very well camoflouged.</p><p>2) <b>Around the areolar</b>: this requires some dissection through the breast tissue to create the pocket for the implant, either beneath the breast or under the muscle.</p><p>As this incision is close to the nipple and the ducts of the breast, which can not be cleaned by the external surgical scrub, some people feel this incision is associated with a higher infection rate as some of the ducts may be cut during the dissection through the breast.</p><p>Again, a saline implant in Brisbane can easily be placed through this incision as it is not filled yet but the larger silicone implants may have a problem fitting through an small incision especially one around a small areolar.</p><p>3) <b>In the armpit</b>: This incision should be well camoflouged unless you raise your arms. This has the same access issues for saline and silicone implants as the other incisions, with the added issue of a long tunnel from the armpit to the breast pocket and the lower level of control in controlling bleeding or in creating a smooth, properly sized pocket through this tunnel.</p><p>As all incisions can be well camoflouged, there is no substitute for exact control at the time of surgery</p><p>I will often use a sizer at the time of surgery as well.</p><h3>Choosing the right size implant</h3><p>Choosing the right size implant in Brisbane is based on your exact body and chest measurements and tissue type. The base width of your chest is only one factor in deciding your implant size.</p><p>You also have to consider how thick or thin your tissue is that is going to provide coverage for the implant and how loose or tight the skin is.</p><p>These are all factors that your surgeon should go over with you. From the measurements you have provided the implant size is likely larger than your body can tolerate over the long term.</p><p>Remember that the more you stretch your skin and breast tissue with a heavier implant than necessary, you will notice sagging of your breasts over time.</p><p>You have to balance short term and long term effects before choosing an implant size that is right for you. You have to let your surgeon know what your goals are for the surgery. If you are only concerned about being as large as possible, then the implant you mention will be satisfactory.</p><p>If you want more of a natural appearance, then a smaller implant would be better. Your surgeon should guide your implant selection process. .</p><p><strong>You will need breast lift</strong></p><p>You have sagging breasts. Lift will certainly be needed. Any implant of adequate size will work for you.</p><h4>BA okay at your age.</h4><p>Breast augmentation is done for all ages. Plastic surgeon do a lot of breast surgery at all ages for many reasons. If your health is stable and well managed you should be able to do a breast augmentation and the face procedure at the same time.</p><p>Inform your surgeon of any medical problems and medications you are taking.</p><p><i>Brisbane Breast Implant Sizes</i></p><p>It is very dificult to give you a precise answer to your question without seeing you in person. In a consultation, I try a number of sizers to give you an accurate idea of what you will like.</p><p>I also take measurements of your chest and breasts. This information is then correlated with the implant manufactors sizes and dimensions. In general, for what you have mentioned, a 300 cc to 350cc moderate profile would be a good assumption.</p><h3>Financing your Plastic Surgery</h3><p>It is my personal belief that patients should not go into debt for cosmetic surgery as it’s not worth the stress. Only recently did we begin offering a 6 month limited financing plan. As for financing, you can not charge more if a patients uses the above mentioned financing company.</p><p><em>Can breast implants be done post reduction mammoplasty?</em></p><p>This is certainly possible. Some patients also need to do a secondary breast lift using the old breast reduction scars if there is excessive sagging after your weight loss.</p><p><strong>An axillary incision can be used if it was used originally and yours is a simple size for size replacement.</strong></p><p>If all you are asking simply to replace your saline implants with a similar size gel implant and there are no other issues to be addressed then an axillary incision is certainly a excellent approach.</p><p>This is especially true if the axillary incision was used to insert your present implants. However, if another (inframammary or areola) was used then my first choice would be to utilize this original incision rather then create a second scar in the axilla.</p><p>In addition, if you desired to substantially increase the size of your implant or needed to release a scar tissue contracture around the implant, the axillary approach becomes less desirable. When you say that your surgeon feels the need to remove your scar tissue this suggest to me that your breasts do have an element of scar tissue contracture.</p><p>This is also referred to as “capsular contracture” and results in the breast feeling unnaturally firm to hard. If this is how your breasts feel then here lies the reason your surgeon wants to remove the scar capsule when replacing your implants.</p><p>Removing the scar tissue plus replacing your saline with gel implants will result in much more natural feeling breast. And yes. the complete removal of the scar tissue is extremely difficult through an axillary incision.</p><p><strong>How Long After Breast-feeding Can I Get Breast Implants?</strong></p><p>A general answer is to wait at least 3-6 months post breast feeding before entertaining the idea of a breast augmentation. This amount of time is necessary for the breasts to settle down.</p><p><strong>Who decides on implant size?</strong></p><p>Here’s how I do it: The patient tells me what she wants, I examine and measure the patient and her try on a range of sizes that will fit their chest. She tries on the implants in a snug sports bra, puts on a form fitting t-shirt and looks in a full length mirror.</p><p>Usually there is an implant in this range that suits them. I also have a bajillion before and after photos and I only use the examples that have similar anatomy to the patient. There are physical limitations to breast augmentation (although there seems to be no limitations when it comes to the imagination).</p><p>If a patient is being unreasonable about what is possible with what they bring to the table, I have them go on line and try to find a before and after of a patient that fits what they look like now and what they want to look after surgery.</p><p>This provides a little dose of reality. Also, ask yourself this: How many breast augmentations have you done? Unless you are a plastic surgeon with a lot of experience with breast augmentation, I would really listen to the advice of your surgeon.</p><p>Don’t make the mistake of “shopping around” for a surgeon that will cave to unrealistic requests. </p><p>On last thing – I would just love to have long, straight, thick strawberry blond hair but my hair dresser knows better than to encourage such desires!</p><p><b>All implants ripple – it is a misconception that only saline implants ripple.</b></p><p>All implants experience rippling, to various degrees. It is just a matter of whether one can see them or feel them. Visible rippling is an issue for most patients, and if you cannot tolerate it, then you may not be a good candidate for breast augmentation, and fat transfer breast augmentation may be a better alternative.</p><p>Saline implants have more prominent rippling compared to silicone implants because saline is not cohesive (gel-like) compared to silicone. Let us understand rippling a bit better. Rippling is the appearance of ridges, wrinkling, or scalloping on the implant that may be visible through the skin.</p><p>Women who have at least 2cm of pinch thickness to their skin/fat overlying the implant will not see much if any rippling. Very skinny women will see rippling no matter what (since all implants have some degree of rippling).</p><p>Rippling can be seen on the outer perimeter of augmented breasts: on the side, bottom, or in between the breasts. Rippling can be caused by the under-filling of the implant, or because of pull on the tissue capsule that is attached to thin overlying soft tissue (i.e., skin and subcutaneous fat tissue, and breast tissue).</p><p>Unfortunately, rippling worsens with time as the implant puts pressure on the breast tissue and thins the overlying tissue. Rippling is common in patients who are very skinny, have very little fat to hide the implant, and have small breasts compared to the implant itself.</p><p>Weight loss may worsen the situation. To correct rippling there are solutions depending on their applicability:- If someone has under-filled saline implants, have them over-filled moderately. This is more of a preventative measure. Over-filling prevents the shell from folding onto itself although, it can result in unnatural firmness.</p><ol>
<li>If someone has textured implants, have it changed for a smooth surface</li>
<li>If someone has large implants, have it changed for moderate sized implants so that breasts can better conceal the implant</li>
<li>If someone has saline implants, have it changed for a silicone implant (although this will only slightly improve rippling)</li>
<li>If someone has the implant placed above the muscle (subglandularly), then have it placed behind the muscle (submuscularly)</li>
</ol><p>Saline implants ripple more over the muscle (subglandularly), but the rippling can be hidden behind the pectoralis major muscle due to a thicker layer of soft tissue that conceals 2/3rd of the top of the implant.</p><p>Rippling may still appear on the outer side of the breast, just above the breast fold and this is especially true if you lean forward or bend to pick up something off the floor. Final 2 solutions can be applied in any case:</p><p>Weight gain – weight gain will allow greater soft-tissue coverage – i.e., padding – the better the implants and rippling is concealed. But since this is not an option most women would chose, fat transfer could be considered. Fat transfers soft tissue for additional support and coverage to area where the implant is visible</p><p>This is the only surgical option, but there is unpredictability in the outcome due to less than 60% fat graft take.</p><p>Also note that rippling is often a problem for thin patients, and such patients have very minimal fat for fat transfer. That being said, it definitely looks like you are taking precautions to avoid rippling: having the implant moderately overfilled by 20 cc extra (250 –&gt; 270), you are going for a moderate sized implant (I am assuming this is not overly large considering your breast characteristics, such as breast width and skin stretch), and you are placing it in the subpectoral pocket.</p><p><b>Rippling</b></p><p>Rippling occurs less often with silicone implants and alsoless with those placed under the muscle. As for the correct isze for you, I could only be sure after an exam. .</p><h4>Good advice for breast asymmetry.</h4><p>It sound to me, based on your description, that your surgeon has given good advice. Your breasts, however, can change over time. This is effected by pregnancy, weight gain and loss, gravity, menopause, and othe variables.</p><p>This is true of the unaugmented breast as well. But it seems as though your surgeon will get you off to a good start.</p><h4>Long term results after treating breast asymmetry</h4><p>Doing different procedures on two breasts is like doing breast surgery on two different people – they are never exactly the same. However, with an experienced plastic surgeon, your breasts will probably look very similar.</p><p>There may some differences in shape, feel, scars, and size. I would expect that you will look very good in clothes, and pretty good out of clothes. Even if your result is not absolutely perfect, you will be much better off afterwards and much happier in the future.</p><p>Down the road, you may require some revision surgery on one or both breasts, but you will be able to enjoy your new breasts for many years.</p><p><i>Failure of a saline implant is easy. Failure of a gel implant is hard.</i></p><p>Saline implants collapse as the salt water escapes the capsule the body places around the implant. The breast goes flat.</p><p>Not a health issue but requires replacement. Silicone not so easy. The gel is contained by the capsule and the volume of the breast does not change.</p><p>MRI scan is the best test but it is 10% inaccurate. That’s a lot when you consider an operation hangs in the balance.</p><p>Failure to detect silicone leakage is not a big problem however.
