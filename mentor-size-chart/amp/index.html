We have two of these and our patients and staff love the accuracy.</p><p>Choosing implant size is the most difficult decision in breast augmentation surgery. I typically use four principles in my practice: I have you look at four sets of pictures that give me a general sense of the look you are seeking by asking the question, “if these were your breasts would they be too large, too small or about right?”</p><p>People typically fall into the four categories of an athletic C cup look, a full C cup look, D look, and supersized.</p><p>This allows the surgeon to get a rough idea of the “look” you want. Then, I have patients place sizers in a bra we provide and under their normal clothing.</p><p>This only approximates the volume needed. See update above for Mentor sizing system. Measurements of your breast are taken to pick an implant that fits within the natural dimensions of your breast.</p><p>During surgery, I use a temporary sizer to see how the implants fill out your existing breast shape, and I ask my patients to allow me 25-50 cc’s of wiggle room to get them a better result if I see fit at the time of surgery.</p><p>A small minority of patients are still very nervous about the size before surgery and wish to pick an absolute size, which is appropriate as well with guidance about how the implant characteristics will change once under the existing breast. (Pramit Malhotra, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The best way that I know of (and one I use for my patients) is to try the implants on during a consultation. There is nothing like seeing the implant on your body. Everybody is different and has a different breast /chest size. You cannot rely on the pictures and other people’s experience. (Gregory Turowski, MD, PhD, FACS, Corona Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing the Mentor Implant Size</h3><p>Choosing the right implant size is one of the most important elements of breast augmentation surgery. It is a process involving both the patient and the surgeon. In my practice, the following steps are taken: Patient expresses their desired size – often in terms of “cup” sizes. I examine the patient and make breast measurements (breast width, sternum to nipple distance, nipple to inframammary fold distance, etc).</p><p>I then have patients do sizers with various bras. I have a home kit that allows patients do the size trials at the comfort of their home. I want patients to take their time with this process.</p><p>I encourage patients to try on various clothing (swimwear, intimate wear, sweater, etc) until they find the size they feel most content with. And then I reconciliate, i.e. – I determine whether the size chosen by the patient can be placed based on the anatomic measurements and breast tissue/skin compliance.</p><p>For the most part, I try to minimize my input for the size determination, as I truly feel this is a personal decision, and ultimately, patients have to feel content with the size chosen.</p><p>However, if I feel that the size chosen is not compatible or may compromise the outcome (too tight looking, etc), then I will discuss my concerns with the patient to convey the pertinent anatomic considerations. It is important to remember that an implant in itself is just one component that determines the size outcome. Obviously, it is in addition to the native breast tissue. Also, the very same implant placed in 3 different women of different height, weight, and physique will produce dramatically different size outcomes. This is the reason why I discourage patients from choosing the size based on photos or friends telling them what size will be “perfect” for them.</p><p>Size chart has to be placed within the context of the specific patient’s body/breast to have true relevance. Lastly, although, we discuss breast sizes in terms of “cup” sizes, implants come in “cc” filling volumes – i.e. – how many cc’s are prefilled (in case of silicone implants) or desired filling (in case of saline implants). So ultimately, most plastic surgeons do not guarantee a certain “cup” size, although unfortunately, it is the only “language” that we have for commmunication. In my practice, I try to focus on the “look” rather than the “cup” size. My home kit is based on the appearance in front of a mirror, while the patient is “blind” to the actual volume. This allows patients to choose the size mostly based on “what they see” and not on “what they think they need.” Ultimately, there are many ways to determine the right size. My method is just one way that works for me and my patients. Be sure to discuss with your surgeon their preferred method, and see if it makes sense to you. Be actively involved with your size – after all, it’s your breast/body, and you have to be happy with it. (Christopher Chung, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implant size chart</h3><p>The question of breast implant size is one of the most challenging decisions for patients to make. In my practice, this is a decision that is made after discussion, measurements, and trying on implants within a bra.</p><p>Some women are quite definitive and can decide a size within ten minutes while others return 10 times, each time with five new friends and 6 different dresses.</p><p>One way to try and determine size at home is to take the foot of a panty hose, measure different amounts of rice (ranging between 150 milliliters and 800 milliliters), and place them in your bra.</p><p>This can also give you a good sense of what size you are looking for. None of this, however, makes up for a consultation with a plastic surgeon! (Christopher J. Davidson, MD, FACS, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Implant Sizes</h3><p>One of the most difficult decisions is to choose the right implant size , you have to consider your chest size and fat on your breast.</p><p>There is no rule of thumb but consulting with an experienced and conservative Doctor will be the best (Jhonny Salomon, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The right breast implant size</h3><p>There is no “right” size chart, because patients all want different looks. In general, a cup size is approximately 150-225 cc per cup, depending on how large the patient is.</p><p>Therefore, 450cc would make a DD in almost every thin patient who starts with almost nothing. The only good way to see what you like is to try on sizers at your doctor’s office and look in the mirror. (Frederick G. Weniger, MD, FACS, Hilton Head Island Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing the right breast implant size</h3><p>When it comes to breast augmentation, it is important for patients to express to the surgeon their expectations regarding size, shape, cleavage, projection, and any other concerns. One of the most important considerations is the size of the implant. Future cup size is based on many variables and can be hard to predict. That is why it is very important for the surgeon and the patient to pick out the appropriate sized breast implant together. Failure to do so can result in very unhappy patients (as well as the surgeon).</p><p>The best way is to try on sizers that are made especially for breast augment patients. Look in a mirror with a sports bra in place and the sizer placed on top of the breast. Then put on your top and again look into the mirror. This is a very accurate method to determine the best Mentor implant size to achieve a certain look. (Kurtis Martin, MD, Cincinnati Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implant sizes</h3><p>My best advise is to choose a plastic surgeon that uses a sizer bra system like the one from mentor. This will help immensely in determining a good size. It takes a different amount on everyone depending on their frame size, amount of breast tissue and chest width. Also, bringing photos with you of breasts that you think look good will help you and your plastic surgeon decide on a size. (David Nicholas Csikai, MD, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Implants Can Be Chosen To Give You A Natural Look</h3><p>The concern you raise, regarding breast implants and an unnatural look, should be a part of any consultation you go to. With breast augmentation, the goal in almost all cases, is to provide a natural appearance. That is to say, to avoid the problem of being top heavy. To do this, the correct size, projection, shape and implant material can have an impact.</p><p>Having access to a Vectra system that can give you and idea of what your eventual breast shape will be should help allay your fears and give you more control in telling your surgeon what you want to look like. Most importantly, make sure your surgeon is really hearing you when you tell him or her what you want your end result to be.</p><p>Find a surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery who you like and trust. An unnatural result should not be the goal. (Jeremy Pyle, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What Breast Implant Size is Best for You.</h3><p>The safest method to determine which breast implant is best for you is to choose a board certified plastic surgeon who will listen carefully to your goals and desires. At consultation, you can carefully describe what you want. Often times, you will be able to try on implants to communicate to the doctor the look that you desire.</p><p>It’s fun and educational for you and the surgeon. (Dustin L. Reid, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing Breast Implant size chart</h3><p>Based on the width of your chest and breast, your height, and your preference for shape and fullness your plastic surgeon should recommend a few implant sizes that will fit your body and give the results you want.</p><p>The ideal way to visualize what the implant will look like is using 3D imaging to simulate your result. Your surgeon may have this technology available. (Cory Goldberg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implant size</h3><p>Breast implant size is a highly personal choice. After your consultation, your surgeon will likely suggest an Mentor implant size based on your body frame and your goals. (Dennis Dass, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to choose the right size breast implant</h3><p>Implants come in 2 basic shapes – round and anatomical (“tear drop”). If you are concerned about a “top heavy look” (excessive upper pole fullness), then an anatomical implant may give you the result you are looking for.</p><p>Determining the correct implant size is a mixture of science and art. The science comes with the measurements you plastic surgeon will perform determining the width of the breast, the distance from the nipple to the fold and how much “stretchiness” there is in the breast.</p><p>The art comes from having you put on a bra and trialling different implant volumes to see how it all looks on you. (Damian Marucci, MBBS, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Mentor Breast implant size selection</h3><p>The selection of the implant size for breast augmentation is a source of anxiety for many women. While there are many different options available, both in volume and projection, picking the proper implant is an important step in getting the result that you desire.</p><p>Many surgeons and patients, including online galleries, use volume to describe the implant. However, I strongly feel that a 3 dimensional approach is best to create a natural result. The width of the implant should closely match the base width of your breasts and chest.</p><p>That will help avoid the large space between the breasts after augmentation which I think looks unnatural. The projection of the implant can then be selected based on your skin elasticity and the type of look you desire. For a fuller, more implanted look, a higher profile implant can be used. For a more conservative look, a more moderate projecting implant can be used. This approach will determine the volume as the final dimension. I do use an implant sizing system in our Albany office to further help with the selection process. These can be tried on with a bra and shirt to help visualize the look of the final result. In addition, discussion between the woman and her surgeon can be greatly helpful. Best of luck with your breast implants. (Jeffrey Rockmore, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing breast implant size should be straightforward</h3><p>The only rule to follow when choosing breast implant size is to trust your own eye and your own preferences for size and proportion. This is best accomplished by undergoing a “sizing exercise” or trial in your surgeon’s office during which you get to try on an assortment of different sized implant sizers and actually look at yourself in the mirror to tell how you would look. Mentor actually has a very well-designed system of implant sizers (not actual implants), specially shaped and designed for this purpose. We use this technique on every one of our augmentation patients, and we have done so for many years.</p><p>We have an extremely high satisfaction rate when it comes to size, and we have very, very few requests to exchange Mentor implants because the size is wrong. Other methods like looking at pictures and guessing, putting rice or water in bags into your bra, using morphing software, taking exhaustive measurements of your breasts and chest may add to this, but in my opinion, nothing replaces a good old fashioned trial run. (Joseph L. Grzeskiewicz, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
