These can include your anatomy and pre-existing breast shape and size, your chest wall size, available skin and muscle, and of course your wishes.</p><p>This is a very important part of any consultation you have with a plastic surgeon. Be sure to ask many questions and expect clear answers. Your surgeon will no the various implant choices including sizing and profiles. Discuss any concerns that you may have. (George Volpe, MD, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Important decisions: Size and Profile in Breast Implants</h3><p>The single most important factor in choosing size breast implant is the base width of your breast. An implant that is to narrow will cause the cleavage to be wide. An implant that is too wide will look very heavy and rub against your arm.</p><p>During your consultation, and her surgeon should measured this distance. From there, if you choose to look a bit more augmented a high profile or ultra high profile device is a very good option.</p><p>If you desire a more natural appearance, then choosing to a moderate classic or moderate profile device we will achieve this appearance.</p><p>There are also shaped or “gummy bear implants” which can provide a fuller look. Rest assured, there are many types of options to achieve the look that you desire. (Salvatore Pacella, MD, MBA, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing the right implant</h3><p>Choosing the right size of implant is probably the most challenging decision you and your Plastic Surgeon will make. Every Plastic Surgeon does their sizing a little different, but most use a combination of measurements and pictures to arrive at the final size.</p><p>When we first meet we will talk about your goals for your surgery. We start off the conversation with your current cup size and what cup size you want to achieve. This is only a rough estimate as every woman knows that cup sizes can vary widely based upon the cut of the bra, manufacturer etc.</p><p>Our goal is to try to get patients to start thinking about their desired size not in terms of cup measurements, but rather the actual look they want to achieve. Next, we do a physical exam taking precise measurements of your breasts. This is the time that we will go through any asymmetries you may have and if you have sagging ( or ptosis) that may need to be dealt with.</p><p>Based upon these measurements I will recommend a few sizes of implants that I feel will give you the best result and be proportional to your body. These recommendations are a starting point only. We will then educate you on the different types of implants ( saline vs silicone), what the different profiles of implants mean ( moderate profile vs high profile etc.) and what size range ( or cc’s ) you should be thinking about. It may seem a little overwhelming reading this, but we will take the time to answer all of your questions and by the time you leave our office you will have all the information you need to choose the right size implant. (Scot Martin, MD, Las Cruces Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Patient feedback on their aesthetic preferences is critical. After all, it is not about what I think looks best – it is all about the patient. My patients bring pictures of sizes they like but also the look they like. This way I can make sure that what they are expecting is something that I can do. And if not, I can discuss the limitations with them. After trying many different methods over the last 17 years in practice, I believe looking through pictures with patients of different size and shaped breasts is the most helpful.</p><p>I almost never choose the actual cc’s before surgery but I will discuss a range if the patient desires. There are over 300 implants in my facility to choose the best size and shape for each patient. I use the base diameter measurements and then pictures the patient has chosen to determine the sizer in surgery.</p><p>After the sizer is placed, I can choose the appropriate profile implant and the correct cc’s based on the width and projection. We are so fortunate to have so many implant profiles, sizes and shapes to choose from. It has never been easier to choose an implant that best matches the patients specific anatomy than now. It is much more of a customized procedure today. (Kimberly Short, MD, FACS, Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of Breast Augmentation</h3><p>There are several things that comprise the cost of breast augmentation. There is the surgical fee, the cost of the implants themselves (silicone being more expensive than saline), the cost of the anesthesia and finally the cost of the facility (hospital or surgical center).</p><p>Furthermore, in New Jersey we have “cosmetic tax” which is currently at 4%. That all said the cost of breast augmentation in our area ranges from about $6000-$8000 all inclusive. (Asaad H. Samra, MD, New Jersey Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of Boob Implants</h3><p>The cost is very variable depending on geography. In Tampa, its anywhere from $5800-$7000. It also depends on saline versus silicone. I would not choose a doctor on price alone because the cost of a botched job is far greater emotionally and financially.</p><p>I personally only operate in a certified facility with a board certified anesthesiologist. Go with the board certified plastic surgeon with who you feel comfortable. (Raj S. Ambay, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost for an Augmentation Mammaplasty?</h3><p>Costs really depend on the area that you live. In St Louis, MO the costs range from about 5000-6800$ depending on whether you get saline or silicone implants.</p><p>If a lift procedure is needed, obviously the costs would be higher. (Christian Prada, MD, FACS, Saint Louis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Boob implant pricing</h3><p>The cost of breast augmentation surgery certainly varies dramatically based on geographic location. In the Raleigh-Durham region of NC, the cost varies from $5000-$7000 for saline implants and $6000-$8000 for silicone implants.</p><p>The cost of the procedure typically includes the surgery, anesthesia, OR fees, and compression garments along with follow up visits. There are other areas of the country that I have seen charge as little as $3500 for saline implants and as high as $9500 for silicone implants. The cost of surgery is always a factor, but should not be your primary deciding point in choosing a surgeon.</p><p>The reputation, before and after photos, board certification, and comfort level with your surgeon are much more important factors that will determine if you feel that you received the proper value for you money when all is said and done. (William T. Stoeckel, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Good Price For Breast Augmentation</h3><p>The price of Breast Augmentation may vary widely depending who is performing the surgery and where they are performing it. Beware of the surgeon with and extremely low price. They may have poor qualifications and are often not board certified plastic surgeons. They may also be performing the surgery in an unlicensed facility or without a board certified anesthesiologist present.</p><p>While price should be a consideration, don’t compromise your health, safety and long-term result for the sake of money. In my practice in Sarasota, Florida the price for breast augmentation is $5200 for Saline Implants and $6200.00 for Silicone Implants.</p><p>This price includes all surgical, anesthesia, laboratory and operating room costs. Keep in mind that most patient are seeking a natural result so it important to find a surgeon who is willing to take the time to look at you as an individual.</p><p>The surgeon should ask in detail what size your breasts are now and what size you would like to become. He should measure and examine your breasts in order to help determine the correct size implant to meet your needs while maintaining a natural appearance. He should ask about any history of pregnancies, weight gain or loss, any biopsies, or a family history of breast problems.</p><p>This takes time and is often not done by the lower cost surgeon. An excellent way to get to know your surgeons style is to look at his web site and before and after images. If these images are not excellent then look elsewhere. Do you see patients similar to yourself? Make sure you ask the following important questions:</p><ul>
<li>Does the surgeon operate in a certified ambulatory surgery center and not just an office?</li>
<li>Does he use board certified anesthesia doctors to put you under anesthesia?</li>
<li>How long has he been performing breast augmentation and is it a common procedure in his practice?</li>
<li>Will there be any additional costs for the initial consultation, anesthesia, operating room fees, laboratory work, or follow-up visits or garments?</li>
</ul><p>Above all, don’t make your decision on who will perform your surgery based just on who has the lowest price. Be sure and look at the whole picture and take the time to do your homework in order to find the right plastic surgeon for you. Look closely at his before and after images. Ask you family doctor or internist if they would recommend the doctor you have chosen.</p><p>Make certain they have privileges to do breast augmentation at a nearby hospital.If not, this is a bid red flag Most importantly make sure your plastic surgeon is certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, and is a member of The American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. (David L. Mobley, MD, FACS, Sarasota Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The cost of breast augmentation surgery may vary</h3><p>he costs of breast augmentation surgery may vary depending on the type of implants used, the presence of any concomitant mammary pathology that needs to be treated at the same time and the facilities of the clinic, also may vary from one country to another, or one state to another, for example in Dominican republic average costs can range from 3000 dollars to 4000 dollars the package. (Jose Luis Acosta Collado, MD, Dominican Republic Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Total Cost of Breast Augmentation</h3><p>Breast Augmentation surgery prices can vary widely. In my practice based in Sydney, the total cost for this procedure ranges from $9000-$12000. Where you fall into that range depends on the hospital you choose and the type of implants (as tear-drop shaped implants are more expensive).</p><p>I only operate in fully accredited hospitals with an anaesthetist and use the highest class of implants as achieving your optimum result in a safe environment is paramount in my practice.</p><p>Beware of lower priced options, as where you have your operation and what implants are used, are almost as important as having a fully qualified plastic surgeon perform it, and often questions patients don’t consider.</p><p>Rather than make your decision largely based on price, do your research, speak to friends who may have had the procedure and I encourage all my patients to seek at least two plastic surgeon consultations before embarking on what is a very important decision. (Kevin Ho, MBBS, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of Breast Implants</h3><p>Breast augmentation prices vary depending on the case and the type of implants that are used and the experience of the surgeon. We use high cohesive silicone gel (gummy bear) implants. We are located in Cancun, Mexico and we estimate the price at $4,750 USD for our Breast Augmentation package this includes:</p><ul>
<li>Medical/Nursing/Anesthesiology</li>
<li>Fees Surgery</li>
<li>Center stay (if recommended by the Dr.)</li>
<li>Medications (Antibiotics, Anesthetics, Pain control)</li>
<li>All Cancun area transfers (airport-hotel-clinic)</li>
<li>Labwork</li>
<li>Compression Garment(s)</li>
<li>Cardiology evaluation (if needed)</li>
<li>Personal bilingual assistance</li>
</ul><p>(Alfonso Gonzalez Cepeda, MD, Mexico Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of Breast Implants and Augmentation</h3><p>There is a wide range of prices for breast augmentation in the Denver, Colorado area. In most practices the total cost for silicone implants, surgeon fee, anesthesia fee and operating room is in the neighborhood of $7500. Saline implants will be less expensive but may not be the best long term value.</p><p>Some practices charge more, some less. Beware of those who charge significantly less. There is a reason for that. Some are not very experienced or not very good and need to build their practices by steep discounting. If you have to pay for someone to redo your surgery, it’s no bargain.</p><p>Some practices charge a low fee and then balance bill you if they take more time in the OR than they charged you for. We guarantee our fees. Some quote for saline implants which are less expensive than silicone. Over 95% of patients go with silicone so make sure your quote is for the correct implant.</p><p>If you get saline and end up redoing it for silicone, it’s no bargain. Some practices save money by operating in their office and don’t use an anesthesiologist. Ask yourself if your safety is worth more than a few hunderd dollars. Be sure to interview several experienced board certified plastic surgeons.</p><p>Ask to see many before and after pictures and see if they have a number of actual patients who are willing to discuss their story with you. Surgery is a big investment in your life. Shopping by price alone is not a good idea. (John Squires, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
