You are not even close to being the oldest Breast Augmentation at our practice.</p><p>As long as you are in good health and not an anesthesia high risk, then better late than never.</p><p><strong>600 cc</strong></p><p>I can’t tell you whether 600 cc will make you a D, but there are some things I probably can tell you. If you have had one child and no sagging or stretch marks you are probably extremely lucky and with good genes.</p><p>I can also probably tell you that going from an A to a D you probably will NOT look natural and you may end up with tight thin skin and breast tissue and possibly even some sagging, but natural — I would say no.</p><p>To determine the size of implants on a patient I use a number of factors. They include body shape and size, height, weight, chest and breast measurements, skin elasticity and other factors. I also use a portrait 3-d imager to determine breast size and show patients how they can look in 3-D with various size implants.</p><p>If you definitely want to be a D then by all means go ahead but I think at your starting size you may be asking for problems down the road when you want to go smaller.</p><h3>Breast Feeding with Breast Implants – Possible? What Are the Risks? </h3><p>You may benefit from in person consultation with well experienced board-certified plastic surgeons. Most patients are able to breast-feed after breast augmentation. It is okay to have the procedure done before you finished having children; You will not be exposing the infant to any risks.</p><p>When the time is right, see consultation with board-certified plastic surgeons to more specifically discuss your concerns, placement of incisions, timing of surgery… </p><p><strong>Connecticut breast implant longevity</strong></p><p>In my experience, most implants will last approximately 15 years. If your physical exam and/or x rays don’t show any change in implants at 15 years, then obviously you would not have to replace them at that point.</p><p>In the current state of things, though, you can most likely expect to replace your implants at some point in time.</p><h5>Large Breast implants + Saggy breasts = sagging larger breasts</h5><p>Large Breast implants + Saggy breasts = sagging larger breasts. You are a better candidate for a breast lift and an appropriately sized implant to match your size and shape.</p><h3>Can I Get Breast Implants WITHOUT Lift?</h3><p>You say you like your size but you want to be “just a bit fuller.” Breast implants will increase your size, give uplift, and make you “fuller on top”, roughly in proportion to how large an implant you choose.</p><p>You would have to be very significantly larger to improve all three things. I’m not sure what you mean when you say you “want to keep the “flip” under the breast” so make sure you and your plastic surgeon understand what you mean by that.<br>
As far as “working out” and your “fear of loosing my breast” is concerned, you need to clarify that as well. It sounds like you want to work out but you are concerned about the effect on your breasts.</p><p>You can expect more sag in the future, but you can have some control over this by keeping your weight stable and avoiding exercises that stretch the skin and ligaments supporting the breast. </p><p><strong>Implants with sagging breasts</strong></p><p>While it IS possible to perform implants only in someone who absolutely reuses the scar/incisions associated with lift, lift with implants will give a superior aesthetic result. Please see attached web reference.</p><p> Good luck and be sure to use a BCPS with expertise in breast surgery!.</p><p><em>Recommend a lift with implants</em></p><p>It looks to me that you have extra skin on your breasts secondary to your weight loss. You can have large implants placed to add volume and roundness to the breast but you will probably have extra skin on the bottom of your breast.<br>
High profile implants are nice in that they have higher volumes at lower base diameters. Placement of the appropriate-sized implants with a lift will give you the best result.</p><p><b>Enhancing Your Breasts</b></p><p>In your case, you’ll have to proceed with a breast lift if you want pleasing results. Implants in Connecticut will not lift your breasts.</p><h3>Your weight should not be an obstacle when considering breast augmentation </h3><p>Your weight should not be an obstacle when considering breast augmentation as long as you are an appropriate candidate for the procedure .</p><p><em>Care Credit – breast implant financing</em></p><p>I personally DO NOT RECOMMEND “CARE CREDIT”. I use another credit company ( that I will not mention so I can not be accused of advertising for them). The reason I do not or have stopped using them are 2 fold: The majority of the applicants are already lower income or financially strapped individuals.<br>
So the only approval from Care Credit is an additional fee to me, the providing doctor. I’m not in practice to help pay for the patent’s surgery. I know I can look at it as a discount from me to the patient.</p><p>But I have been given no decision making in that issue, just a fee of a % on the loan. I find that very distasteful. The second issue, though most find it very minor, is I need an additional terminal in my business office.</p><p>It caused some confusion and I like things simple. So from your question concerning the “exorbitant fees”, I fully agree with the doctor. She has a right not only to protect the patient but also herself.</p><p>No doctors are suppose not to increase their fees to cover the additional costs of financing, but each to their own. Just safe and than get the surgery from MIAMI.<br>
<strong>Does the price of surgery include post-op visits?</strong></p><p>In most practices this is the case. Routine post-operative care is included in the surgical fee. However, each office handles revisions and treatment of complications differently. It is a good idea to discuss your surgeon’s policies in this regard pre-operatively.</p><p><em>High or moderate profile Breast Implant to get my goal?</em></p><p>You have a very well specified goal look and knowing that look is quite helpful to the surgeon when choosing the right implant style to meet that goal. Your goal photos show models with high profile looks so that is the implant your surgeon will be looking at for you.</p><p><i>Breast augmentation after breast feeding</i></p><p>I typically have my patients wait 4-6 months after they have finished breast feeding before proceeding with a breast augmentation. When you are breast feeding, your breasts typically become larger because of the increased glandular activity.<br>
It usually takes several months for your breasts to involute (lose some of the increased volume) and quit producing milk. You may want to consult with a board certified plastic surgeon and discuss what his or her recommendations are.</p><h4>Breast implants are too small…</h4><p>It is not unusual for women to feel that they “should have gone bigger” at this point in the recovery. I would suggest waiting until at least your 6 month point before making a final decision.</p><p>If you still feel the need to go bigger, it will be easier to do after 6 months and you will have a clearer idea of what you look like and what you’ll want. At this point, your body is still changing and you are not seeing the final result.<br>
You didn’t mention the size of your implants. This would be helpful in determining how much bigger to go. If your surgeon took photos of you on a Vectra 3D system, he could show you simulations of larger implants.</p><p>If not, estimates can be made based on how much bigger you want to be. For now, I would suggest waiting until you are at least 6 months out from your procedure. </p><p><i>Breast Lift and Smoking</i></p><p>I would say no. It is recommended by the plastic surgeon society and the literature that 2 weeks is what is needed. But I would recommend a minimum of 2 weeks, really want 4 weeks of smoke free, not even 1 cigarette.</p><p>It is a risk, you may be fine you may not be. It is difficult to predict who will have problems and who will not.<br>
<em>Natrelle Textured saline implants vs Smooth implants in Connecticut</em></p><p>There may be specific reasons that a plastic surgeon uses textured implants. Here are the common reasons: if the implant used is a shaped (ie ‘teardrop’) implant, it only comes as a textured implant to prevent it from rotating once inside the pocket there is concern that the implant will fall or descend excessively (occurs with patients who need their inframammary folds lowered significantly, patients having implants replaced because of bottoming out, patients who are quite thin and do not have a well developed inframammary fold) there is a concern about capsular contracture (not as significant a reason) </p><p>I think there are some disadvantages to using a textured saline over a smooth saline the implant does not tend to move naturally there is a higher risk of rippling (esp in patients with little breast tissue) implant failure tends to occur earlier because the implant is relatively immobile, and the same areas on the shell become repeatedly stressed<br>
These days, I rarely use textured saline implants, and only for cases where the patient has a high risk for implant malposition (see above) when she has previously ‘bottomed out’.</p><p>You should find out why your plastic surgeon chose to use this type of implant, there may be a very reasonable explanation.</p><h5>Uneven breasts</h5><p>Almost every single patient I see has two very different breasts. Some have an A cup and a D cup. In order for your breasts to appear more symmetrical, I suggest a lift on the right and bilateral asymmetrical augmentation.</p><p>I perform at least one case like this almost every day. You can expect your breasts to appear more alike but never exactly the same. Ultimately, if you do your research and find the right surgeon, you will be happy with the result.</p><h3>Replace breast implants when they break</h3><p>Most saline and probably also silicone implants will last 10 to 20 years. l see no point in replacing them unless they’re broken. You’ll know when they break, and go to your doctor then. If only one breaks at 10 to 20 years, it may be best to replace both.</p><h4>You will need to have lift</h4><p>Your decision should be based on what is your expectation and what procedure will give you the results. Breast lift will give smaller areola,higher nipple position and perkier breasts.</p><p><b>Post op blues</b></p><p>The first weeks can be really difficult– physically and especially emotionally after any cosmetic surgery and breast augmentation is no exception Assuming your surgery went well this may be a normal reaction. Although several factors may be involved causing this including underlying stress, medications, psychological tendencies, etc – many women experience a sequence of emotional feelings “Emotional Rollercoaster” following aesthetic surgery – but it does pass.<br>
Having a partner, family member , or friend who is supportive can help this process. The stages of emotional ups and downs if understood in advance can help you stay calm and get you through this process more quickly.</p><p>Phase 1 – Being Out of ItSwelling and discomfort is most severe over the first few days after breast augmentation. Pain medications also can make you disoriented and emotional. Phase 2 – Mood SwingsHaving just had breast augmentation you are adjusting to a sudden change in your appearance with much anticipation.</p><p> The presence of bruising, swelling, and edema, your breasts aren’t going to be look like the final outcome. Mood swings especially sadness, worry and depression are common. You may even ask: “What have I done?” or think that “I never should have done it” Phase 3 Being over criticalDuring the second week you will probably be feeling a lot better.</p><p>The edema (swelling) and muscle cramping/spasms if implants were under the muscle will be decreasing and stiches out.. Because of anticipation it is natural for you to look critiacally at your new breasts worrying about symmetry, scars, and so on.</p><p> So; it’s normal to wonder if you acheived your goal and “what you paid for” . This is too soon to tell and most concerns are resolved with time. Phase 4 Happy at lastFinally, about week 3 or so, you will probably start liking how you look and are feeling much better.</p><p> You may be in the mood to buy your new bra to check out the size difference, check out some bathing suits or tops to show off your new figure and show off. Larry Nichter, MD, MS, FACS .<br>
<i>Sports Bra and Tighter Bra After Breast Implants?</i></p><p>For an optimal breast augmentation results the breast implants in Connecticut need to be free to move normally with your breast and body and not be restricted tightly to 1 position. All is important to wear a sports bra when running or doing vigorous physical exercise, I do not like the fact that a tight sports bra can restrict motion of the implant and interfere with a normal process of adjusting to your body and forming a nice large pocket to allow the implant to freely move.</p><p>In fact I encouraged my patients to go without a bra at home the first few weeks if they are comfortable doing so.  I also instituted breast implant displacement exercises again to keep the implant freely movable.</p><p>When you do worry bra is soft, but supportive “no wire” bra is what I would recommend. to learn more read below.</p><p><i>Breast lift after breastfeeding</i></p><p>I think your breasts would have dropped whether you had implants or not. If my patients are planning on having children in the near future I encourage them to think about waiting but the decision is up to them.</p><h4>Will my Implants Appear Smaller Once Swelling Reduces</h4><p>Thank you for submitting your question. Your very early in the recovery phase. The swelling will go down in in the next few weeks. Many times swelling is asymmetrical and implants will drop at different rates.</p><p>Your breasts will change and soften during that time. Give it time and discuss your concerns with your Plastic Surgeon.<br>
