This fee includes the surgery center and anesthesia. Typically the only additional cost is the consultation, $50.</p><p>You receive a complimentary copy of my hard-back, full color book titled “Ideal Breast” with your consultation.</p><p>Remember, it is a mistake to spend too much on your breast augmentation, but may be a bigger mistake to spend too little.</p><p>There is no economy in redo surgery. My goal is to provide top value, putting a priority on patient safety and surgical expertise, which comes from 26 years of experience.</p><p>Included in the price is ultrasound surveillance for blood clots, which is a new safety measure. I have attached a link to my website in case you wish to read more. (Eric Swanson, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How Much Do Breast Implants Cost?</h3><p>I’m a plastic surgeon in Columbus, Ohio. At my practice our implants can cost anywhere from $1,000-$1,500 (each). This is all dependent on the type of implant we use.</p><p>The total cost for a standard augmentation in Gainesville including implants, surgeons fees, anesthesia, and facility fees ranges from $7,000-$8,000. (Timothy Treece, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Average cost of Breast Implants in Gainesville, FL</h3><p>The costs associated with breast augmentation in Gainesville are based on several factors which include: the time allotted for the procedure, surgeon and facility fees. Surgeon and facility fees will vary depending on your location and the type of facility.</p><p>The first step is to find a board-certified surgeon who you feel comfortable and decide if you are a good candidate for a breast augmentation. Your health history will be considered for safety reasons, in my practice, patient safety is our number one priority. (Brian Coan, MD, FACS, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The price varies by geography and practice type. Average costs include the plastic surgeon’s fee, the facility fee, the anesthesia fee and the implant cost. Often advertised prices appear more attractive because they don’t include all the associated costs. Silicone gel implants are about twice as much as saline. Total price in South Florida ranges from $5000-$8000. (David J. Levens, MD, Coral Springs Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Price of breast augmentation</h3><p>Price of breast augmentation really depends on the surgeon and city in which your surgeon is located. In Gainesville, this can range from $6000 to $10000. Saline implant usually cost less than gel implants. </p><p>There is at least a $1000 difference between the two.</p><p>The brand of implant (Allergan or Mentor ) are also may be different. You should also find out if the price includes anesthesia, surgical centre fee and not just your surgeon’s fee. Finally in Gainesville, there is a HST as well. (Colin Hong, MD, )</p><p><strong>Average cost of breast implants</strong> will vary from plastic surgeon to surgeon. Typically there are four components that are to be considered: Surgeons fees, Anesthsia cost, facility fees and implant costs. </p><p>In my practice there are also an optional fee for an extended release injectable pain medicine to help with the post op recovery.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_477" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Like everything in life you get what you pay for. The lowest priced breast augmentation maybe that way for a reason, and you may not feel it worth it in the end. At the same time paying the most does not guarantee best job in town. Do your research, meet the doctors you have identified in our area and the. Make the decision based on your comfort level with price being a 3rd or 4th level of consideration. (John Mancoll, MD, Virginia Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The price for Breast Augmentation saline $2800 to $3500 and silicone $3500 to $5000, Seek for a Plastic Surgeon the perform hundreds of this procedures. (Orlando Llorente, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Average cost depends on surgeon and the place</h3><p>I am a board certified plastic surgeon based in Hyderabad India. In my practise breast implant surgery costs 3000-3500 USD including hospital , surgeon and anaesthesia fees plus the cost of silicon implants. (Priti Shukla, Mch, India Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Many years but probably not forever</h3><p>Gainesville Breast implants can last years or even decades, if no issues, such as capsular contracture, implant rupture, or implant migration occur. However, they are not considered “lifetime devices.” The FDA recommends MRI screening 3 years after silicone implants are placed, and every 2 years thereafter.</p><p>Many plastic surgeons advise their patients to consider swapping out their breast implants after 10-15 years. If you have a rash, pain, and the perception of air pockets, you should see your plastic surgeon for an evaluation. (Lara Devgan, MD, MPH, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How long to breast implants last?</h3><p>The manufactures of breast implants suggest in their literature that implants should be replaced every 10 -15 years.</p><p>However, I have had patients that have had them in for many years past that timeframe. Many of the newer devices have thicker shells, better functioning valves and different viscosity for gel filling.</p><p>Although your implants may seem to be okay on the outside, there could be an issue that you are unaware of. Making sure that you have regular diagnostic tests such as Mammograms, Breast Ultrasounds or Breast MRI’s can help to determine how well your older implants are holding up.</p><p>There are also some signs that there may be an issue that you can look for such as “hardening” of the breast. If the shell has degraded and some of the silicone is leaking or bleeding out, your body may increase the thickness of the scar tissue or capsule surrounding the implant making your breast feel firm or harder than before.</p><p>This could be a sign that it’s time to make a change. (Suzanne M. Quardt, MD, Palm Springs Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Implants Should be Replaced Every 10 Years</h3><p>Typically, breast implants should be replaced about every ten years. Not doing so raises your risk of rupture and other complications. (Anna I. Wooten, MD, FACS, Pittsburgh Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Lifespan of Breast Implants</h3><p>There is no absolute time at which breast implants need to be replaced. If you have saline implants they can stay in place as long as they are intact. If they leak you would see a loss of volume on the affected side. The FDA recommends that three years after placement of a silicone filled breast implant a patient undergo an MRI of her breast and every two years thereafter to look for a silent rupture.</p><p>A ruptured implant should be removed and replaced. It has been common practice among plastic surgeons to replace older implants in an effort to avoid a rupture. Ten years is an arbitrary number.</p><p>The rash and tenderness that you are describing warrants a visit to your surgeon for a diagnosis. (David K. Funt, MD, Long Island Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>When do implants need to be exchanged</h3><p>Breast implants usually do not need to be removed even after an extended period of time. However, there is a small percentage of implant failure, on the order of 15% after 15 years. If you have developed a significant change in the shape of your breasts, discomfort, redness, or new lumps you should contact your surgeon for a thorough evaluation.</p><p>This exam may include an MRI exam if you have silicone implants to rule out rupture.</p><p>I routinely have my breast implant patients return for an annual exam to catch problems early.</p><p>If there is a problem most implants can be removed and replaced with an outpatient surgical procedure. (Andrew Goldberg, MD, Fairfax Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How long do breast implants last?</h3><p>Reviewing my colleagues answers, there are so many different opinions! How confusing when the experts don’t agree. Here are a couple of thoughts:</p><ol>
<li>If you have saline implants there there is nothing to do unless you don’t like the look of the implants or one side deflates.</li>
<li>For silicone implants, rupture does not affect your overall health risk for the vast majority of patients.</li>
<li>If your silicone implants do not look right or one breast becomes firm (capsular contracture) you should have a revision.</li>
<li>If your silicone implants are soft and in good position there is no medical reason to replace the implants, regardless of age.</li>
<li>Many patients are worried about rupture. No judgement here, some people have more anxiety than others. It was elective surgery to place them, it is elective surgery to replace them. (Bradley A. Hubbard, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><h3>How to pick the Best Implant Size for My Body?</h3><p>Finding the right size implant for you is guided by advice from your board-certified plastic surgeon based on hearing what you want, making measurements, and ideally using 3D computer imaging to show you anticipated results you could expect through simulations with various sizes of virtual implants.</p><p>This amazingly accurate technology allows both you and your surgeon to come to a mutual understanding of what implant size and style will give you the look that you want.</p><p>The ability to “predict the future” of your new look takes the guess work out of implant selection.</p><p>Seek a plastic surgeon in your area that can offer you a consultation with 3D computer imaging. (Scott A. Brenman, MD, FACS, Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Which breast implant is right for you?</h3><p>Implants are a quite personal decision. My patients have the opportunity to see a Vectra 3D rendering of what they will look like and also use the sizing system to see how clothing would fit and how they will feel with the bra using different size implants in Gainesville.</p><p>I have no regrets form patient wanting to go either larger or smaller. Find somebody that can give you these kind of options to get a good estimate of your choices and have no regrets after surgery. (Humberto Palladino, MD, FACS, El Paso Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing Implants that Don’t Look “Top-Heavy”</h3><p>Fortunately there are many different styles, shapes and sizes of implants that a patient can choose to create whatever look is desired.</p><p>There are low profile and moderate profile shaped implants that provide less projection and in turn a more natural look. Also, going with a size (or fill) that fits your body and breast measurements will help to prevent the “top-heavy” look.</p><p>When selecting a plastic surgeon, you can ask if they do “implant sizing” where they allow you to try on the implants during your consultation or pre-operative appointment in a sports bra to get a general idea of how you will look. Also, the best advice is to not listen to well meaning friends or Google as often you can receive misinformation from these sources. Your best bet is to talk to your board certified plastic surgeon about your concerns. (Suzanne M. Quardt, MD, Palm Springs Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>You don’t want to look like a stripper?</h3><p>Though ultimately the size of a woman’s breasts are based on her desires and sense of aesthetics, the surgeon is there to provide educated guidance. A rule of thumb is that the base width of the breast implant should be equivalent to the width of the patient’s chest wall (from sternal border to armpit).</p><p>If a patient is very petite, large implants will appear unnatural. If a patient is thickly built, then large implants will make her look more stocky and matronly. In addition, large heavy implants will compress the patient’s naturalbreast tissue and stretch her skin envelope more than a more moderate size choice.</p><p>With these concepts in mind, a woman can begin a frank discussion with her surgeon. (David K. Funt, MD, Long Island Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing a Breast Implant size</h3><p>It is important to find a surgeon that believes in achieving natural appearing results to avoid an overdone or augmented look. During your consultation, we review the various options regarding implant shape (round vs anatomical) and position (above or below the muscle), along with your personal goals, to help guide our surgical planning. Several measurements are made to find the correct implant width that will best fit your body. Based on those dimensions, a small range of implants will be suggested that you can then try on to see what they look like. In my opinion, a natural look is the goal and we will only let you choose an appropriate implant to get you to that result.
