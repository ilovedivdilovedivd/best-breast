<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Breast augmentation is an excellent procedure to contour and shape the breast. If you would like to correct the sagging of the breast, either from a breast lift or a breast lift with implants. Neither procedure will interfere with your history of breast cancer.</p><p>If you have a family history, you should have already been receiving annual mammograms for screening. Before your surgery, it is recommended to receive an updated mammogram as your baseline. After your surgery you need to inform the x-ray technician that you have implants so that they can modify the procedure of your mammogram.</p><p>By taking additional views, they will be able to image your entire breast and continue your screening. To learn more about breast augmentation, see photos, and help you decide which one is best for you, please visit us at the link below</p><p><strong>Uplift needed</strong></p><p>You would not get a good cosmetic result without an uplift. Implants alone, no matter how big, would not correct the shape of your breasts and would either sit too low (if placed above the muscle) or too high (if placed under the muscle).</p><p><b>Possible but with trade offs</b></p><p>You can have an augmentation without a lift – but trade offs are inevitable. Your slightly downward turning nipple can be slightly improved with some internal techniques to help rotate up the nipple – but it will not be the same as with a lift.</p><p>A nice improvement and upper pole fullness can be delivered without a lift – but if you are looking to change the overall shape and vector of your breast tissue- a lift is needed.<br>
<b>An unusual answer to a common question</b></p><p>We get this question a lot and note it is usually the scars that are the issue. Personally, you have a generous chest size and I would simply do a mastopexy now. If you wish, you can always add volume later via implant or fat.</p><p>If you just put In the implants you will feel bad about how you look naked and will definitely need a second surgery. It is definitely cheaper (but not easier) to do the operations together.</p><p>Look for someone boarded by the American board of surgery, and maybe even the aesthetic society.</p><p><em>Smoking and Breast Implant Surgery </em></p><p>Stopping smoking for atleast two weeks before any surgery is a good idea especailly if it invloves general anesthesia, as the intubation might worsen post op coughing. Certain procedures in plastic surgery will have more problems in smokers when it involves raisnig flaps like facelifts, abdominoplasty, brest reduction/lift etc.<br>
Breast augmentation does not involve flaps and it is not mandatory to stop smoking although it is a good idea.</p><p><strong>How long is an average bed rest after breast implants?</strong></p><p>There should be no “bed rest” after a breast augmentation. You should be able to walk around the same day. However, you will have “light duty” restrictions for a few weeks (no heavy lifting). Most of my patients can resume desk work in a few days after a Rapid Recovery Breast Augmentation.</p><h5>Is a lift needed?</h5><p>Given your breast shape, severity of sagging, and nipple position, you will definitely need a breast lift with your implants. I would strongly advise against an augmentation alone because this will create larger saggier breasts and the result will not be flattering.</p><p>If you are hesitant on a breast lift, I would simply hold off on any surgery. The lift will help correct your sagging and improve your overall breast shape. Please visit with a board certified plastic surgeon to learn more about your options.<br>
<i>Breast augmentation options</i></p><p>First I would like to commend you for seeking consultations with board-certified plastic surgeons. There are so many ‘cosmetic’ doctors these days who are self-proclaimed experts in cosmetic surgery and who have never had any formal training in plastic surgery.</p><p>Some of the scary ads I have seen are for family practice, OB-Gyn, and ENT (ear, nose, and throat) doctors performing breast augmentations which they have had no training in. There are also many ‘bogus’ societies that some doctors claim to be a part of in order to confuse the public as to their actual qualifications.</p><p>The only specialty board recognized by the gold standard American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) in the discipline of plastic and reconstructive surgery is the American Board of Plastic Surgery. </p><p>All other boards, including the American Board of Cosmetic Surgery, have NOT been approved for membership by the ABMS.<br>
Now back to your question. When patients undergo surgery, although we strive for the most favorable end result, there are usually several ways to get there. </p><p>This is especially true when it comes to aesthetic surgery, which is a mix of fine surgical technique and artistic vision.</p><p>With our extensive training and prior surgical experiences, plastic surgeons will offer the technique that they feel will provide the best cosmetic results. We can employ different techniques and methods, and there is no ‘one’ right answer.</p><p>Thus, all of the options you mentioned could provide a nice aesthetic result for you. That being said, based on my experience and training, it appears that you have grade 1-2 breast ptosis (sag). The larger the implant, the more auto-lift it can provide which can negate the need for a mastopexy (lift), but it is difficult to tell without doing a formal exam.<br>
You may need a modest crescent or periareolar (donut) lift to center your nipple-areolar complex after augmentation. One option if you really want to avoid the scars from a lift are to perform the augmentation first to see how things settle, then do a lift at a second stage if it is needed.</p><p>Either way, I always recommend going under the pectoralis muscle which tends to lead to a more natural appearance, as well as decrease the incidence of capsular contracture.</p><h3>Augment no lift</h3><p>if your nipples are quite low on the breasts, implants alone may not provide sufficient improvement in their position. As with your surgeon I usually suggest my patients consider a breast lift in this situation.</p><h4>Is seven months enough time to recover from breast augmentation?</h4><p>Yes, most patients can resume normal activities in a couple of days and unrestricted activity within 3-4 months. I would expect a patient to be doing exceptionally well by seven months. </p><p><strong>UNDER the Muscle is The Way To Go</strong></p><p>The MOST important goal that assures a good breast augmentation is getting the best and maximal coverage of the implant with your own soft tissues. Placing breast implants under the breast / over the muscle works only in women who ALREADY have enough breast tissue.</p><p>Doing so in women such as yourself inevitably results is sub-standard results which are hard to fix (with breast thinning, rippling) and a higher likelihood of capsular contracture scarring (due the constant amount of bacteria normally living in the breast ducts).</p><p>You REALLY should have your implants partial sub muscular or dual plane.<br>
<em>PA breast lift with augmentation</em></p><p>You are a good candidate for periareolar mastopexy (lift with an incision around your areola only) and placement of anatomic silicone implants under the muscle. This procedure in the right hands will give you a great result without extensive scars.</p><p>Also it will make the areolar size smaller and more aesthetically pleasing. We wary of breast augmentation if offered to you above the muscle for “lifting” effect.</p><p><em>Breast Augmentation: Getting your size right the first time</em></p><p>I think first and foremost, you asking questions and doing your research is great and a key factor in getting the size you desire the first time around. Several details need to be taken into account.</p><p>What is your height and weight? A patient that is 5’10 vs a patient that is 5’2 will have very different “visual” results using the exact same cc implant. Your body structure and personal taste will be important considerations.<br>
Get a wish pic. This is a picture of your ideal breast size on someone similar in stature to yourself. Set realistic goals. Breast augmentation doesn’t always equal breasts that look like Victoria Secret models.</p><p>Your breast should be the ideal version of YOUR breast after augmentation. I say this not to deflate you, but to help you determine what goals you want to accomplish via breast surgery. Once you are sure of your goals (full cleavage in a blouse vs maybe just more volume in the upper pole of your breast vs larger and very natural to very large) a board certified plastic surgeon should be able to recommend a size that will leave you happy the first time around.</p><p>Just a side note, many of my patients say post surgery that they love their breast, but wished they had gone a bit larger. Fear of going too large usually subsides to the latter emotion.<br>
Be confident once you choose!</p><h3>Moderate Plus vs HP </h3><p>The moderate plus design of implants does the best job of providing a looks good but natural look. At 13cm, that would put you in the 400-425cc range. In the HP, that puts you at 475-500cc range.</p><p>The HP add more upper pole fullness ( not necessarily fake look), so it really depends on what you want to achieve – more natural looking or more full appearing.</p><h3>Prices From Realself:</h3><h3>Breast Augmentation Prices</h3><p>2011:</p><ul>
