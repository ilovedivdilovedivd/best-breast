<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Saline implants in Oklahoma City can look and feel relatively natural in women who are starting with a fair amount of breast tissue (B cup is better than A cup in this case), and when the implants are placed under the muscle.</p><p>Long term issues in salines without muscle and tissue coverage include rippling and palpability of the implant shell. Silicone gel filled implants are more natural feeling (less like a water balloon) and are very safe, if that is your concern.</p><p>These implants were approved in Nov. 2006 by the FDA who concluded that they are not linked to autoimmune disease or cancer. </p><p>Did you also know that the shell of a saline implant is also made of a silicone polymer shell? Most people aren’t aware of the fact that they are actually getting silicone whether it’s a saline or silcone gel-filled implant.</p><p>I tell my patients that if it is the safety of the implant that is the issue, then try to get past that since both are very well tested and safe as approved by the FDA of the US.</p><p>The long term benefit of a more natural feeling breast with silicone gel implant with less rippling issues over the years usually leads them to pick this type.</p><h3>Am I a candidate for breast augmentation? </h3><p>Yes, you can get a breast augmentation but it looks like you will need a breast lift as well in order to get the nice results you want. Do a web search for pre and post op photos and print out the ones you like to show your surgeon.<br>
With that information an experienced and artistic surgeon should have no problem getting you to your goal.</p><p><b>Implants for a runner?</b></p><p>I have a lot of runners in my practice, including several who have done marathons, half marathons and triathlons. The current number of choices in <b>breast implants in Oklahoma City</b> is very good, and the implants themselves are very durable.</p><p> If you are worried about leaks, you might want to consider the structured implant made by the Ideal Implant company. The key would be not to go too large. </p><p>Also you need to discuss in detail with your plastic surgeon the recovery process and when they would allow you to return to running.</p><p>Usually this is a gradual process, starting out with short runs and progressing, much like getting into shape after not running for a long period of time.<br>
<b>Pregnancy with Breast Implants</b></p><p>Your breasts are going to change through out your lifetime. However, pregnancy will have the most noticeable changes. For purposes of breast feeding, the tissues will swell, the breasts can become sore, your skin will stretch as your breast volume grows, then it will deflate as it goes down, the skin will or will not shrink back down and leave stretch marks based on a variety of factors.</p><p>This will all happen with or without an implant being there. If you are planning on children in the immediate future, it might be best to wait on breast augmentation. After breast feeding, you may find you also need a breast lift, or mastopexy.</p><p>This can then be done at the time of the implant surgery. However, in general, there are many, many women with implants who have children. It’s not going to change the process that much. (Ability to breast feed *may* be a factor.) It just depends on timing</p><h5>Breast implants</h5><p>First, I do not think that you have a BWD as wide as you think you do. The choice of implant should be reivewed with your surgeon at the time of your consultation. You should easily find an implant that will be right for you.</p><p>If I had to guess you probably are about 11-12 cm base diameter.</p><h4>Patient or Doctor-Who Should Choose The Size?</h4><p>It is one we hear fairly often and my answer is, “Both!”. The process of choosing a breast implant is always challenging. The patient wants a size that will make her happy but she is hearing lots of “advice” from friends and others.</p><p>The Bra Industry doesn’t help by not standardizing their sizes so just using cup size is out. The doctor has good intentions but really has only known you for a few hours or so.</p><p>So how do you choose? In my practice, both of us choose. We use a sizing system and we use photos similar to what has been described by the other responders to your question. We then combine that information with your measurements and your breast tissue characteristics to develop a range of sizes and profiles that will work best for you.</p><p>If the patient chooses to go larger in size than the I feel she can support, then I explain to her the risks of going beyond what I feel her body can support both in the short-term and in the long-term.</p><p>Ultimately, the patient gets the final choice since it is her body and yes, there are times that I decline to be the surgeon when I believe the size selected will cause the patient more harm than good.</p><p>The goal should always be the safety of the patient and to do no harm. In the near future, we will be adding a 3-D imaging system to further help our patients select their implant sizes.</p><p>It will be another tool in our system to get the choice right the first time with your selection but make sure you and your surgeon are both comfortable with the size you choose.<br>

<i>Asymmetry correction of tubular breast and enlargement</i><p>I am only second guessing here, and will inject my philosophy. I think that if you have a tubular breast, it needs a lift to look good. This will make the smaller breast even smaller.</p><p>Now this brings us to the larger, non-tubular breast, and what to do about it. If it is perfect, leave it alone. </p><p>The biggest challenge is symmetry. if you put a small implant in, it may look fine, or it may cause other problems (the diameter will be smaller than the larger implant).</p><p>If the larger breast needs a lift, then it might be a good idea to reduce it to the size of the tubular breast and give them both the same size implants.<br>
<b>Average bed rest after breast implants</b></p><p>Guidelines for post operative care will vary from surgeon to surgeon. We generally suggest 3 to 5 days before returning to work although that may change depending on how demanding your job is.</p><h4>I know I have a breast deformity, but what kind and how severe is it?</h4><p>“Puffy nipples” are often associated with tuberous breast deformity. Breast augmentation surgery in OKC may improve the overall appearance of your breasts and areolae. However, consultations with your local plastic surgeons will help to determine the best surgical options for you.</p><h3>Second consult</h3><p>Not at all go for it some patients of mine do it and its fine to go over things again to ensure you are on the same page as your surgeon.</p><h5>Oklahoma City Breast augmentation without lift</h5><p>Every patient has different goals, concerns, and fears. If your goal is just to have fuller breasts and are willing to accept the mild droop of your breasts, then just get implants. If you want to get an idea of what it could look like, go to my website and look at patient #2032 in the breast augmentation photo gallery.</p><p>She has breasts that are similar to yours and did not want a lift. She is very happy with the result because in clothes or a swimsuit, she has the illusion that her breasts are lifted and she has no breast scars.</p><p>My personal opinion is that if a woman’s nipples are above the breast fold (as you show in one of your pics), they can still get a beautiful result without the need for a lift.<br>
<i>Depends on whether they are saline or silicone</i></p><p>If they are saline implants and there are no problems with them they should be fine. If there is a problem, have it evaluated by a plastic surgeon. If you have silicone implants that are 30 years old, you should probably have them replaced.</p><h5>7 Month after breast implants</h5><p>Congratulation for the marriage, and yes 7 months is more than enough to have a complete recovery of this surgery. Go for it. </p><p><b>Textured or smooth implants in OKC</b></p><p>The textured implants in Oklahoma City were designed to theoretically reduce the tendency for contracture of the scar capsule that surrounds all implants. Capsular contracture results in squeezing of the implant which may produce increased firmness, visible deformity, or discomfort.</p><p>There is no conclusive evidence that texturing actually does reduce capsular contracture. The textured implants are perfectly safe! However, you need to discuss with your surgeon the decision to use them, rather than what you requested.<br>
<b>Transaxillary approach gives excellent results in augmentation</b></p><p>Transaxillary augmentation in Oklahoma City is an excellent approach to augmentation in those individuals who are more comfortable with a scar that is off the breast. The incision in placed high in the crease under the arm and the implant slid down into a submuscular position.</p><p>This approach was very popular several years ago and has not received the attention today that it deserves. There should be no difference in the augmentation result when comparing the underarm approach, around the nipple, or a breast fold or inframammary incision.</p><p>All simply provide access through which an appropriate pocket is made to accommodate the selected breast implant. Augmentation through each approach may be done well, or done poorly. Surgeons who do not use this approach may not be comfortable with it or be able to do it well and rely on what they feel is a more “direct” incision.<br>
All incisions do fade, however you should be able to have an excellent augmentation through a transaxillary incision and avoid a breast scar if you wish</p><p><i>Choosing The Right Implants in Oklahoma City?</i></p><p>I would advise you to have a consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon.  You can then go on from there with a sizing and picking the right implants. </p><p><em>Oklahoma City Saline Breast Implants Leaking</em></p><p>Usually a saline breast implant leaks fully right away such as a deflated balloon. You will sometimes feel a burning sensation in the deflated breast. This deflation is not related to any taste sensation in your mouth.</p><p>If you do suspect a leak you should go to your Plastic Surgeon and be examined to see if you need a replacement.<br>
<i>Breast Massage</i></p><p>There is a big controversy about this among plastic surgeons and some advise massage while others strictly forbid it. You should discuss this with your plastic surgeon. I am attaching a video of our exersise regimen.</p><h3>Underwire Bra Post-Breast Aug</h3><p>For my patients, I typically use an inframammary or breast fold incision. Because this area needs to heal and therefore must not be irritated by the underwire, I have patient wait approximately 6-8 weeks before they are allowed (and many times comfortable) to wear an underwire bra.</p><p>Have your surgeon review with you his/her protocols and bring your bras to the office to have them evaluated and “fit” for you. There are a number of “acceptable” bra design with wires and a number of “unacceptable” bras for after surgery.<br>
<i>Textured vs smooth</i></p><p>Texture vs smooth is a great question that can get complicated. In full disclosure I have used textured implants from all 3 companies in the US and choose different texture for different purposes. TEXTURE MAY DECREASE SHIFTINGThe most common implant used around the US is a smooth round silicone implant.</p><p>But they can move more and can shift to the sides or inferiorly with time. So texture gives the implant more “grip” and may prevent it from shifting as much with time. So in a patient with looser tissues who is at more risk for implants shifting the texture may be a benefit.</p><p>It may be helpful when the fold is lowered to decrease additional dropping of the implants and malposition of the fold. It is always used with anatomic implants to prevent rotation and flipping of the shaped implant.<br>
TEXTURE MAY DECREASE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE</p><p>Years ago there was an implant in the US with polyurethane around it (MEME) that had a very low risk of capsular contracture- they haven’t been on the US market for many years because of a possible risk as the polyurethane would break down and release other chemicals.</p><p>But doctors in practice before my time spoke very positively of the low rate of contracture. Current studies show a benefit of textured silicone in reducing capsular contracture when implants are placed above the muscle- not as much of a difference when below.</p><p>And methods such as nipple shields during surgery/ no touch technique/ antibiotic irrigation to decrease biofilm formation may be even more important. </p><p>TEXTURE MAY INCREASE RISK OF PSEUDOCAPSULE FORMATION AND LATE SEROMA<br>
There are important differences in the aggressiveness of the textures of breast implants in the US.</p><p>The most aggressive texture is a salt loss method-salt crystals are placed on the implant during manufacture and are then dissolved, leaving a texture. This texture may allow tissues to adhere better-but has also been linked to a higher rate of late fluid collections (seromas) and pseudocapsule formation-the tissues can tear away from the implant with activity and lead to several layers of scar tissue forming around the implant.</p><p>Another company doesn’t discuss their method of texture but is in between in aggressiveness. And one company simply stamps the texture into the implant and has the least aggressive texture. Interestingly the “coefficient of friction” which is a physics measurement of the implant grip, is the same with the most and the least aggressive textures.<br>
Could this less aggressive stamped in texture be equally effective at reducing shift of the implants but with a much lower risk of late seroma and pseudocapsule formation than the salt loss texture? Finally, BIA-ALCL (Breast implant associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma) is a VERY rare type of cancer that develops in the fluid or capsule around an implant.</p><p>It was reported in April at our national meeting that 278 cases (out of millions of women with breast implants) have been reported around the world, with the majority of the cases being associated with the salt-loss texture and only 5 case being associated with the least aggressive texture.</p><p>Breast augmentation in Oklahoma City is about understanding the tradeoffs. It is important to have a detailed discussion with your board certified plastic surgeon about the various tradeoffs/benefits of texture and how they apply to your case.<br>
I find that I am now using round textured silicone gel implants in more of my primary breast augmentation patients. I feel that the tradeoffs are in favor of the least aggressive texture in these cases.</p><p>Also, there are many different implant choices and size options. 440 seems extremely large for a “thin girl” who is 5’3″ and 100 lbs. You might look into the “Five critical decsions in breast augmentation using five measurements in Plastic Reconstr Surg 2005”.</p><p>It is important to find an implant that fits your tissues properly without overly stretching your tissues. An implant that is too big can cause more problems down the road.</p><p><b>Risks of breast implants in OKC</b></p><p>Like any other surgery there are risks. The specific risks of breast implants include: Infection, Bleeding, Hematoma, Capsular contracture, interference in sensation, lactation, and interferance with mammograms. Displacement of implants, too big, too small; In saline implants, rippling, feeling the edge of implant.<br>
Both can rupture or leak. There may also be a need for another surgery in the future. Deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary emboli are also possible. A good Board Certified PS can take measures to reduce the risks.</p><h4>Oklahoma City Implant size </h4><p>The size is less important than the style or shape. If you want natural then I’d go towards a shaped implant. Size is easy to determine after you see a surgeon and also after they take some simple measurements, namely breast width.</p><p>If you want it to look natural I’m guessing somewhere in the 300-350cc range. This combo will give you a very natural slope to the breast with a nice filling of the bottom half of the breast and can sometimes give an appearance of a lift.</p><h3>Periareolar lift and perky breasts</h3><p>A periareolar lift does not really “lift” the breast, but rather moves the nipple to a more superior location. This tends to give the illusion of a lift but also flattens the breast. From your pictures, I believe you would most benefit from a vertical lift, which gives the best lift and the most perky result.</p><p>It also has the least amount of scarring compared to an anchor incision. With time the vertical fades nicely. I would choose a breast implant based on what cup size you desire.</p><p><b>Revision breast augmentation in Oklahoma City should not be too painful</b></p><p>Pain is a very subjective thing, and so it is hard to make any promises. If your muscle has already been stretched, I would anticipate that your surgery would be a bit less painful the second time around.<br>
<strong>Do implants lift the breast </strong></p><p>The main goal of implants in OKC is to improve and increase volume ,but there is a small breast lift that occurs as well.
