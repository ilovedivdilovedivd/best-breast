<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Choosing the proper saline implant size is obviously an important step when a woman undergoes breast augmentation and I spend a significant amount of time making sure that we have arrived at a choice that she will be very happy with.</p><p>Of course, this varies from patient to patient and depends on her desired outcome and also her existing breast size, shape and skin envelope.</p><p>The range of patients expectations vary from those who desire to be small and natural to other women who clearly want to look implanted and fake. When consulting with your plastic surgeon, a thorough discussion regarding your implant size will be made. It will be essential to discuss your desires with them.</p><p>Your pre-existing breast characteristics and dimensions will be evaluated a proper implant will then be chosen. Three dimensional imaging may also be of assistance.</p><p>Finally the use of sizers can often be helpful in achieving a range that would be satisfactory. Whatever your choice, it is important that you seek guidance from a board-certified plastic surgeon. (Melek Kayser, MD, Detroit Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Saline implant Sizing</h3><p>This is one of the most common questions asked on this forum. When patients do go too large, it does tend to make some women look, as per their words “matronly.”</p><p>In order to determine what saline size implant best fits your body, a physical examination to obtain measurements of your chest wall and breast width would help to answer your question more accurately.</p><p>Since cup size is a ratio of breast volume to chest circumference it is tough to estimate exact post-operative bra sizes. Another confounding factor is that there is no standardization of this ratio by bra manufacturers. However, a loose rule of thumb is that it takes about 150-200cc to make a change in cup size in a 32-34 circumference chest. Therefore if you are a 34A, adding 300 cc’s will likely increase you about 2 cup sizes, likely (but not for sure) making you a C-D depending of how full of an A your are now.</p><p>If you buy 36 size bras you will find that the cup size would be smaller, so you may be 36B-C. Keep in mind, this is a very rough estimate and the goal is not a specific bra size but a look you are trying to achieve. One tool I find helpful is Vectra 3D imaging, where I can virtually implant the different sizes and styles of saline implants. The 3D image of your chest morphs into a pretty accurate representation of your final result with some limitations of course. (Luis H. Macias, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Keeping things in proportion … it’s the key to choosing the right breast implant size</h3><p>Choosing the right implant type and size is one of the most important decisions you and your surgeon will make as you consider breast augmentation surgery. So, great question.</p><p>And some advice:First, decide who you are? Are you an active person? Are you in a professional job? Do you want to achieve a natural look or obvious, dramatic one? Seek out a board certified plastic surgeon that specializes in breast augmentation to help you on your decision-making journey.</p><p>Your friends will offer advice. Do listen to them, but take their suggestions with a grain of salt. They are not experts. A personal consultation with your plastic surgeon will reveal so much. During the exam, your surgeon will lean more about you, your breast history and he or she will take measurements. One of the most important measurement is breast width.</p><p>This measurement will correspond to the diameter of saline implant that will properly fit and augment the breast. Skin can stretch, but if the saline implant reaches the limit or beyond, it will appear more obvious, unnatural and round.</p><p>It may make the woman look heavier. I perform between 400-500 breast breast augmentations annually in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area. In my experience, bigger is not always better. The true measure of breast augmentation success is the appropriateness of the implant to your size and shape. and how well the new profile meets your expectations. You are at the beginning of your process.</p><p>You are asking the right questions. Continue to do so! Take your time, get measured and seek out a qualified surgeon who aligns with your needs. With regard to size, I think you’ll find moderation will usually result in an excellent long term result. All the best to you! (Peter J. Capizzi, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Each breast augmentation patient is destined for a specific implant size</h3><p>In general, I tell my patients that each person is destined for a specific size based on their breast skin, fat, and glandular quality and size.</p><p>There are exact measuremnts that can be made to use as a guideline in choosing the right size.Another interesting point is that your breasts are probably meant to be as big as they are going to be if they were engorged with breast milk.</p><p>This is one of their main functions. Some people grow a lot and some a little. If the skin and breast tissue is stretched beyond this “destined” size, then problems can occur with the implant pushing, stretching, thinning, and damaging the breast skin/tissue early, and then revisions are needed.</p><p>Also, you have to ask yourself what you mean by “breast size.” Many patients confuse size with fullness in the upper part of the breast, the area which shows with low cut clothing and certain cleverly designed bras. If it is fullness here that you want, then you may not have to go so big as you think.</p><p>Lastly, if a lift of the nipple areola is needed, then this is often done in conjunction with the augmentation. A common problem is when someone has had their breasts augmented to a really large size to treat the sagging.</p><p>Moderate to severe sagging must be treated with an appropriate lift with or without an implant, period!Look in magazines.</p><p>Look at friends who have had augmentation. If you have really tight breasts that are small, then there are further limitations.</p><p>You have to be realistic and do what is safest for your body LONG TERM. Not just for short-term satisfaction. (Ashkan Ghavami, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing your breast implants – get ready for a long talk with your surgeon</h3><p>This is a very long discussion that takes place after a thorough physical exam. There are several physical features that impact the size, shape, and route of an implant that would best suit you, including:</p><ul>
<li>Stretch of the skin</li>
<li>Base diameter</li>
<li>Nipple areola size</li>
<li>Goal size</li>
</ul><p>These are just some of the things that are reviewed. Now with so many choices of implants:</p><ul>
<li>Moderate profile</li>
<li>Moderate plus profile</li>
<li>High profile implants</li>
</ul><p>We have so many options to provide you with the best result we can. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Beautiful, natural breast implants</h3><p>There are several important factors in determining the best breast implant size for you:-the size of your frame-your breast measurements (base width, sternal notch to nipple distance, and nipple to inframammary fold distance)-your skin elasticity or stretchability-the amount of fat you have covering your chest-your desires</p><p>Speak to your plastic surgeon about your wishes, and make sure you get appropriately measured and photographed before surgery. One rough rule of thumb is approximately 150-200cc per cup size, although this rule is entirely dependent on your frame and measurements. (Lara Devgan, MD, MPH, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The key lies in choosing the size that’s right for you.</h3><p>Between the advances in surgical techniques and breast implants that feel and look more natural than ever, the only reason for women to have a top-heavy look after breast augmentation is if that’s the final result they’ve requested. The first step I recommend to my patients is to find some photos that show your dream results for how you want to look after breast augmentation.</p><p>As your surgeon, it’s my job to help explain the right combination of implant size, type and profile that will help you achieve that goal. Take the time to find a board certified plastic surgeon who specializes in breast augmentation first, and the rest should fall into place. (Nirav Savalia, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implant sizing is an art, not an exact science</h3><p>the most important thing you can do is selecting an experienced board-certified plastic surgeon who has done lots of augs over many years.</p><p>The same implant will do different things in different patients, so it needs to be fitted to the individual patient dimensionally and also to her desired “look”. in general, larger implants tend to look more “fake” and saline implants have that tendency as well.</p><p>Some women have so little soft tissue cover that it can be almost impossible to completely eliminate the “augmented” look but this is relatively rare. (Bruce K. Barach, MD, Schenectady Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing a breast implant size</h3><p>Breast implants come in a wide range of sizes starting from 100cc up to 900cc. The rule of thumb is to match your implant size to your frame. If you are petite, you should put in a smaller to medium size implant to fit your frame.</p><p>If you are larger framed or taller than average, you would be able to carry a larger implant to fit your frame.</p><p>I have my patients try on several sizes of implants in a bra with a shirt over the bra. Then I have them stand in front of a full length mirror to look at the way their breasts match their frame.</p><p>It seems to be very helpful for women to see the size before they buy, just like trying on clothes. (Stanley Castor, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How Big Should I Go with Breast Implants?</h3><p>The answer to this question is a joint effort by the patient and the plastic surgeon working together. In general, each cup size increase corresponds to about 200cc of breast implant. So, if you want to move from a small A to a full C cup, a 400cc breast implant is in the correct range. The most critical measurement is of the breast width. This measurement corresponds to a number of different implants that will match the width of your chest. With the proper base width selected, there are a number of implants (essentially, small, medium and large) from which to choose from. One size does not fit all; seek consultation from a board certified plastic surgeon to determine which implants are right for you. (Adam J. Oppenheimer, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to pick a breast implant size</h3><p>Discuss your concerns with your plastic surgeon. Show photos of the size you like and don’t like. Most surgeons have a sizing kit or computer software that will allow you to “preview” the end result. (Victor Ferrari, MD, FACS, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Implant Format and Profile is much more important than Volume</h3><p>This is a very typical concern for women that are undecided into getting breast augmentation. I’ll assume you’re talking about silicone, as I never recommend saline to my patients. I’ll tell you something right away: the modern plastic surgery approach is not about the volume of the implant, but its shape, along with the patient’s existing breasts’ tissue. So, 300 cc High-Projection Implant is very different from a 300 cc Medium or Low-Projection Implant.</p><p>This said, what your surgeon needs to take in mind (and explain to you) is how much tissue you have before the surgery (which will add up to the filling of the implant) and what form or shape of breast is what you like the most. A natural breast does not have a full round marked upper pole when the patient is not wearing a bra or a bikini.</p><p>So, if you wish to look elegant without that “stripper look”, you should aim for implants with medium or low projections. The volume (cc) will only be a consequence of the diameter of the implant chosen by your surgeon and the projection he/she wishes to achieve. Another option for that very natural look would be an Anatomically Shaped Breast Implant, which will not fill too much your upper pole, but will give you the projection and augmentation of a natural enlarged breast. Hope this explanation works. (Luis A. Fernandez Goico, MD, Dominican Republic Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing the Right Implants</h3><p>This is a very common concern because most women don’t want the “stripper” look. Remember, more than 300,000 women in the U.S. get breast augmentation every year, so there are millions of women out there with breast implants, and most of them don’t look obvious or top heavy. That’s because good plastic surgeons work with you to determine not only the right size for the implants, but also the right shape and profile (projection) for your frame.</p><p>In addition to using sizers, many of us use sophisticated digital imaging technology to simulate your results and show you what you can expect from different implants. You should have no problem getting the natural-looking results that you want. Good luck! (Andrew Smith, MD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implant size</h3><p>Since no two breasts are the same, even on the same patient I think it is important to measure and photograph the breasts.</p><p>Using this database of information I then have the patient review my book of photos to find a body type similar to theirs and then pick an image that they like.</p><p>Based on that information and careful listening to what the patient desires I can pick out one or two implant sizes and styles that will not overload the patients tissue dynamics and get the result they want.</p><p>I have the patient look, feel and even try on the sizer implants but I do not promise a final cup size. In general the sizers stuffed in a bra will not be what you look like after surgery but It does help patients get an idea of what they like.</p><p>I never want the patient to focus on the number or size of implant such as 350cc or 400cc since this number is only part of the picture.</p><p>Too often I hear my freind has this size and I want to look like her so I want the same size. Seek out a board certified plastic surgeon who is willing to listen to you and let them guide you. (Gregory Lynam, MD, Richmond Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to choose implant size</h3><p>Choosing the correct implant size is an important decision, but not as important as choosing a natural shape.</p><p>Most patients come to see us with a great deal of concern about breast size but a more important consideration is to choose a surgeon who is committed to providing a breast which looks natural and suits your body.</p><p>This means choosing the right implant style and shape and making sure that it is placed in the correct place.either above or below the muscle. At our clinic we do not let patients choose whatever size they want. I usually give the patients a range of sizes that will work for them based on their breast base width.</p><p>In order to keep the breast looking natural, I won’t let the patient stray above or below the range of size that I’ve suggested. That way the patient is involved in the decision making process but always with the advice of an experienced plastic surgeon. (Frank Lista, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Implant Sizing</h3><p>The size of implant chosen for breast augmentation is a very personal decision. While there is no exact formula to determine the ideal breast size for every patient, there are guidelines with the goal being to create harmony and balance between the lower and upper body while providing the patient with long-term satisfaction.</p><p>During the initial consultation or preoperative evaluation, your surgeon will determine your goals for breast augmentation, do a thorough physical exam, and take many measurements. (Jaime Perez, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Most of my patients sound like you. they want to have enough of an augmentation so they felt like the “got their money’s worth”. on the other hand, they don’t want to be so big that their breasts enter the room before they do! i don’t believe there is a rule of thumb for implant size. honestly, there are many factors – how tall you are, your general build, your weight.</p><p>A 400cc implant on a pt who is 5’10 and 190 lbs will look completely different than the same implant on someone who is 5’3 and 120 lbs. play around with the sizers in your doctors office, use rice and a measuring cup and ziploc bags. get your significant other and girlfriends to chime in.</p><p>The one thing that makes this difficult is it is one of the few times that you can make a choice in these matters. i liken it to being able to choose your eye color. if we had this choice it would drive us crazy! so do your best, but don’t let the decision drive you crazy!
