<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Breast augmentation is the most common cosmetic surgery in the United States because it provides a consistent way for a woman to change the shape, position and size of her breasts. The discomfort from implant comes from lifting the pectoralis muscle off the chest and placing implant underneath.</p><p>As your body becomes used to this implant, the discomfort will fade. Now that you have had a breast augmentation you’ve already done the hard work. A revision surgery or an implant exchange will not be as painful as your muscle has already stretched around the previous implant.</p><p>To learn more about breast augmentation, see photos, and help you decide which one is best for you, please visit us at the link below</p><p><strong>Healthy and ready to make a change at age 50!</strong></p><p>There are no hard and fast age limitations. A healthy 50 year old is great candidate for breast augmentation. Whatever brings you to this point in your life is personal, and cannot be judged by age alone.</p><h4>Breast Augmentation Canidate</h4><p>It’s best to schedule a one on one consultation with a Board Certified Surgeon in order to discuss your options as well as to try on the different implant styles and sizes to find the most ideal look you desire.</p><p>There is no right or wrong implant. The choice will vary depending on the patient’s wishes and the surgeons customary practice. In my practice the vast majority of patients request silicone gel implants because they tend to look and feel more natural.<br>
However, many women have saline implants that they are very happy with.</p><h5>Implant rippling: how to reduce the risk</h5><p>Any implant can produce rippling or wrinkling, particularly if you are very thin and have little tissue to cover the implant. To reduce the risk of rippling or wrinkling, have the implant placed below the muscle, choose a silicone implant, and choose the smallest implant that will meet your goals.</p><h3>Breast implants should not affect breasts during pregnancy.</h3><p>The presence of breast implants won’t negatively impact the breasts during pregnancy and shouldn’t impede your ability to breastfeed. Although hormonal changes and pregnancy weight gain will likely result in increased breast size, there’s no indication that implants will make your breasts feel painful.</p><p>It’s common for some women to develop stretch marks on their breasts during pregnancy. However, nothing suggests that implants contribute to or increase the likelihood of stretch marks. Many women with breast implants find that their breasts retain their size and shape following pregnancy.<br>
If you’re planning a breast augmentation followed by a pregnancy, it’s important to give your body 12 months to heal.</p><p><strong>Just implants?</strong></p><p>Although you need a full examination by a board-certified plastic surgeon, it seems that your photographs reveal the need for a breast lift along with augmentation. I think you would need a vertical scar along with a scar around the areola.</p><p>This would give you the most perky and long-lasting results.</p><p><b>Saline implants can be exchanged with silicone implants through the armpit</b></p><p>If a surgeon tells you he has to use a different incision It is most likely he has little experience with exchanging saline implants with silicone implants through the armpit. This is a very comon procedure and if a patient has a significant capsule a capsulotomy can be performed through the same incision.</p><p>If the physician is very experienced with breast augmentation procedures then he should have extensive experience with all of the various approaches and should be able to treat a normal exchange through the same incision.</p><h4>Breast implants do NOT cause weight gain</h4><p>breast implants have a certain weight of their own, but they do’nt make you gain additional weight, and certiainly don’t make you retian water or fluid.</p><p><i>Rippling is related to the thinness of the overlying breast tissue</i></p><p>Even though you are planning to undergo a subpectoral or dual plane breast implant procedure, the most common area where you may experience “rippling” is in the lower outer quadrant, because the coverage is exclusively skin and breast tissue.</p><p>The pectoralis muscle will mitigate against rippling in the upper pole but may also be appreciated in the lower inner quadrant, if the implant is a “standard” profile saline and/or underfilled. Your PS has discussed overfilling modestly, which is beneficial against rippling.<br>
Each saline implant has a manufacturer recommended fill schedule. Do remember that overfilling doesn’t protect from rippling and may result in a harder, narrower breast, which may “scallop” instead. The selection of a “high profile” saline implant somewhat helps with diminishing the palpability of the implant in the lower outer quadrant, however it’s not a fool proof solution.</p><p>The introduction of silicone gel implants is preferable for thin women with little breast tissue coverage, however even silicone gel implants can “ripple”, as we see in our breast reconstruction patients, whose mastectomy flaps are often paper thin.</p><h3>Deflated saline implants</h3><p>The best thing to do is to have deflated implants replaced as soon as possible as this makes the replacement a very simple operation. That being said, there is no harm in waiting and there is no health risk to you.<br>
<i>You can smoke and have breast implants safely</i></p><p>There are increased risks to smokers with some cosmetic procedures, though smoking poses little risk to those who wish to have breast implants. You will feel better if you cut back two weeks before, and feel better still if you quit altogether.</p><h3>To old for breast implants?</h3><p>50 is definitely NOT too old for breast implants! In fact, many women lose volume (size) in their breasts around the age of menopause and their breasts can begin to sag. Great results can be achieved with breast implants with or without a “lift.</p><h5>High riding breast implants</h5><p>Breast implants can be high-riding for months after surgery. It takes time for the implant to drop. If you have large implants placed in a small body with tight skin, it can take even longer.<br>
As long as this improves, you shoul dbe patient. If the implants do not drop, then a revision may be necessary to make the implant lower.</p><p><b>Best implant plane depends on what your anatomy provides</b></p><p>a lateral “lie” to the left breast and a wide internipple distance. The latter finding often makes the creation of tight cleavage difficult, if a patient will not accept a “wide” implant, whose base diameter can be manipulated to “close the gap” between the breasts.</p><p>In my opinion, a small silicone gel implant placed on top of the chest muscle would be preferable to minimize the lateralization which can occur with weight lifting. Many surgeons, myself included, favor the subpectoral or dual plane because of improved superior pole coverage, hedge against superior pole wrinkling, rippling as well as downward displacement, lower capsular contracture, alleged resistance to infection and superior mammographic visualization.<br>
That being said, there are some individuals, like you, for whom this isn’t the best: </p><p>a) women with adequate superior pole volume;<br>
b) women with glandular ptosis;<br>
c) women who refuse submuscular positioning. Do discuss this with your PS.</p><h5>If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!</h5><p>I don’t know where this rumor got started but many paitents iqnuire about this. My general feeling is the old saying: “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!”. The question is: how do you know if it’s broke? That is a more difficult quesiton to answer.</p><p>Salines usually deflate and anyone can make the diagnosis. Current silicone implants tend to maintain their volume and shape making it extremely difficult to detect. This has prompted the FDA to make the 3 year and 2 year thereafter MRI recommendation .<br>

<i>Breast implant deflation</i><p>It sounds as if you may have a deflation on the left side. I would recommend consulting with your plastic surgeon as soon as possible to examine you and discuss the best possible options for you.</p><p>If a deflation is involved, revisionary surgery may be necessary to address the issue. Usually, the implant corporations provide a warranty for the implant if there is a malfunction or defect responsible for the deflation.</p><p>Regarding exercise, the deflation will not affect your range of motion or physical activity. It will not cause you any harm or worsen the issue. </p><p><strong>Under or Over muscle</strong></p><p>This is a topic that will generate much discussion and some strong opinions. It is safe to say that most implants in the US are placed sub muscular; probably more than 80%. This trend seems to have developed over the past 25 years, possibly due to the general unavailability of silicone gel implants it the US for over 15 years.<br>
In other countries, it seems more commonplace for surgeons to place implants in sub glandular pockets. There are pros and cons to both approaches:Over the muscle (sub glandular) is is where the natural breast is actually located Subglandular pockets seem have the advantages of: faster recovery, more natural breast movement and cleavage, excellent choice for women with enough natural breast tissue to cover the implant, women with drooping who want larger breasts who are trying to avoid having a breast lift.</p><p>This approach is worth considering for selected patients who want silicone gel implants and have enough tissue to cover them and may have advantages for patients who have very strong pectorals muscles who may have a lot of unnatural movement with sub muscular pockets.<br>
Sub glandular implants do have higher rates of reoperation for capsular contracture, but probably have lower rates of certain malposition problems, such as bottoming out, because the pectorals muscle is not disturbed during placement. Patients must be carefully selected for sub glandular implants, but this approach can yield excellent results.</p><p>Under the muscle or sub muscular pockets generally provide more tissue coverage for the upper portion of the implant and may be best for many situations, including patients with minimal breast tissue, thin tissue coverage, post-mastectomy or radiation for breast cancer, patients with saline implants, patients who are going to require a concomitant major mastopexy (lift), and patients who require frequent mammograms or who have a high risk of breast cancer (mammograms are somewhat easier to obtain with sub muscular implants).<br>
Disadvantages include significant muscular movement in some patents, a somewhat higher chance of malposition issues such as bottoming out, and less natural, somewhat wider cleavage, particularly in patients who have a wide intermammary distance. A few patients with longstanding sub muscular augmentation, particularly those with large implants or those who have longstanding capsules may have cupping of the rib shape due to pressure from the implant on the rib cage.</p><p>So, one approach may not be best for all patients who want breast implants. When patients are properly counseled and selected, both sub glandular and sub muscular pockets can provide excellent results. Furthermore when a patient encounters pocket related problems with their augmentation, is is not uncommon to change the pocket location to remedy the problem with the previous pocket.<br>
<i>Implants and Brazil</i></p><p>If you are planning to stay in Brazil for several weeks after surgery, it certainly seems reasoanable enough. Find a doctor locally at home that you can follow-up with if you have problems.</p><h5>Unsupervised fellow performing breast augmentation</h5><p>You need to feel comfortable about the surgeon performing your surgery. Cost may be lower with a fellow and the risk/benefit associated with less expense – if that is the case – is really very important.</p><p>If a fellow is performing surgery, there is also a question about who will be following you in a year and on from there.</p><p><i>Choosing breast implant size</i></p><p>I believe it is a combined decision as to size of the implant between the patient and surgeon. I always want larger than the patient. We usual compromise.</p><h4>Under muscle implant placement for thin women</h4><p>There are of course many factors to consider but an important one is coverage of the implant. This is especially important for the upper portion of the breast, in order to smooth the transition from the chest wall into the upper breast mound and avoid a fake look.</p><p>Under muscle placement is very helpful in that regard. It is important to keep in mind though that the muscle doesn’t cover the side or the bottom.</p><h5>Largest breast implants</h5><p>It is important that you understand why selecting the correct implant size is fundamental to a successful outcome. Any plastic surgeon wants you to be satisfied with the result of your surgery. However we know, based on our experience, that if patients have an implant that is too large, the patient will experience short-term and/or long-term complications/undesirable outcomes.<br>
Your plastic surgeon needs to communicate this to you. When we examine a patient, we are looking at how thin or thick your tissues are, including your breast tissue as well as your height, body frame and the width of your breast.</p><p>If you have very little breast tissue, as you described, the implant edges are much more likely to be visible. This will be exacerbated by large implants, resulting in an unnatural and unaesthetic appearance. Furthermore, because of your presumably tight tissues, you will experience significant tissue distortion and stretching with oversized implants.</p><p>Thirdly, I would guess that an implant large enough to give you a DD cup size would be too wide for your existing breast width, again leading to unaesthetic result and tissue distortion. The goal is for you to understand the limitations of your tissues and to select an implant that will do as much as possible, without causing problems for you.</p><p>Try to find a plastic surgeon who will patiently answer your questions and is happy to educate you about this. A good rapport between you and your surgeon is essential for a succesful outcome.</p><p><strong>When your breasts are not like what you want them to be</strong></p><p>you should see some local plastic surgeons for advice and then choose the one you like the best. You have many issues that will impact your outcome and the first is if you’re overweight, get down to your weight you can easily maintain.</p><p></p>

Then options can be presented to you which will include a lift and implants or fat grafting. If your acne is horrible, you may want to get that cleared up prior to any implant surgery to minimize risks for infection (which is catastrophic in implant surgery).<br>
There isn’t much you can do about scarring at this point but some surgeon smay have lasers or possibly be able to revise the worst scars surgically.
