It is important to consult with your plastic surgeon and he may ask you to obtain a through examination from your primary care physician and/or your cardiologists.</p><p>With a properly trained surgeon and anesthesia, you can obtain the look you have dream of.</p><p>You have a tall torso and relative to your collar bone your breasts are “low” on your chest which is why you are feeling as though you lack upper pole fullness, even though your nipple areola is in good relation to the rest of the breast.</p><p>Even though your breasts are slightly asymmetrical, from the photos they appear to be of adequate volume. Without examining you it is difficult to give a definitive medical opinion but fearing you will be too large is a legitimate concern.</p><p>My my guess is that you can achieve an aesthetic enhancement with a mastopexy that reduces your skin envelope and tightens and elevates your breasts, but your cup size will probably get smaller rather than bigger after a mastopexy.</p><p>The he advantage of your surgeon is that he or she examined you and concluded that the scars from a mastopexy may not be justified in your case. I suggest you discuss your concerns explicitly with your plastic surgeon.</p><p>I am sure he or she would concur that if you feel a second opinion is required yiu should pursue that. Your plastic surgeon should be experienced in breast enhancement and board certified, preferably a member of ASAPS, ASPS, or both.</p><h4>Lift or no lift with implants</h4><p>To achieve the best shape and long term result, I would recommend under the muscle and a lift. With the lift I would do, you would have a scar around the areola, and one extending partly down toward the breast fold.</p><p>Both of these scars are often barely visible after about a year in someone with fairly light skin. There is no absolutely right or wrong answer. It just depends what your priorities are…better shape and nipple position or less scar?</p><p>Well here is a fourth opinion I would recommend a subfascial implant with an internal fixation lift . If you want more volume then an implant is enough. If you need a lift that can always be done at a later time.</p><p>If you like your current shape and nipple location, and just want to be bigger, then an implant only on top of the muscle will make you larger. With the extra weight, over time you may hang a little more.<br>
If you want a perkier result with the nipple higher, and a rounder shape, then a lift is necessary, and then you would need the implant under the muscle to help preserve blood supply to the nipples.</p><p>Ultimately, placing implants in Melbourne does alter your breasts in ways that probably cannot be reversed. For that reason I encourage my patients to avoid excessively large breast implants that they may regret one day (due to breast gland stretching).</p><p>On the other hand, you are in my opinion a good candidate to consider conservative augmentation to match your frame since as you say your natural anatomy is good. If you feel strongly that you would like your breasts to be larger than I would encourage you to make the committment and undergo an augmentation in Melbourne aimed at good proportioning.</p><p>Few women are unhappy that they had implants placed and it is quite rare in my experience that they eventually seek implant removal without replacement. Meet with a Bd Certified (ABPS) doctor and express your concerns and questions.<br>
There is never a rush to proceed so take your time in making your decision. </p><p><em>You are the only person that can choose your implant size.</em></p><p>You already have an image in your mind of what you want — the hardest thing to do is to describe that image in words. During my augmentation consultations I take measurements of the breasts and chest in order to give you a range of implant sizes that I can use that would work with your body.</p><p>Then I have my assistants help you try on sizers until you see in the mirror the same image that you already have in your mind. That is how you determine the size that you need.</p><p>I will sometimes adjust that size minimally depending on our discussion and only with your consent and knowledge. </p><p><strong>Good choices for breast augmentation scars</strong><br>
There are many good choices for breast augmentation scars. Usually, the scars are not an issue. Some people are at higher risk for bad scars and that may dictate where the best place for the incisions will be.</p><p>Where I practice in Melbourne, I see many Asian women who have beautiful skin but make bad scars. </p><p>Women who don’t have any droop to their breasts are going to have a more visible scar if made under the breast because their breasts don’t hang over the fold.</p><p>A bigger incision is needed for silicone implants in Melbourne. Consultation with a plastic surgeon who has experince with each of these methods is important to determine what is right for you. There is not one answer for everyone.</p><p><strong>300 cc implants</strong></p><p>Without formally examining you in person, it would be difficult to assess whether the implants are right for you. Based upon the numbers that you mentioned( assuming that they are accurate) I would say you are pretty close.</p><p><em>300 cc Size Implant for a 5’2″ Woman</em></p><p>This seems to be a reasonable size for you. A lot of patients ask whether a certain size will be good for them or not. The answer actually depends on what kind of result is desired.</p><p>Chances are a 300 cc high profile implant will create some fullness over the upper part of the breasts. This tends to create a more rounded look, which is not how a natural breast looks. That is okay.<br>
Many women like to have that fullness over the upper part of their breasts. A natural breast is always a little empty over the upper part of the breasts. This is what creates the “tear drop” shape often referred to.</p><p>If you truly wanted a very natural looking result, you would probably need a smaller implant. Again, it all depends on what you want. Having said all of this, the 300 cc high profile implant is perfectly fine if you want fullness over the top of your breasts.</p><p>I understand your concern regarding the lift, it appears you have significant sagging and the nipple position almost points down to the floor. I do not think you will get a satisfactory results without a lift with your augmentation in Melbourne.<br>
Although a physical exam is required to make any recommendations, I would likely suggest a breast augmentation with a lift to achieve the best results for you. Please see a board certified plastic surgeon to learn more about your options.</p><p><b>Breast lift needed</b></p><p>I don’t think you would be satisfied with just an augmentation. I would actually not consider your augmentation without a lift. The lift will improve your asymmetry, as well as rejuvenate your breast shape. My ideal goal is to have a breast shape that you would not have to wear a bra in a strapless dress.</p><h4>Am i too old for a breast augmentation?</h4><p>Its not about your age but about being medically cleared for surgery; you said you are healthy. You should look for a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon, look at his before and after photos and make sure that you feel comfortable with him.<br>
<strong>Moderate profile would work well</strong></p><p>In most cases, a silicone moderate profile implant in Melbourne works well to give a nice amount of volume without being to wide, but still giving nice projection without looking fake. However, every persons body is different and it is best to discuss the different implants with your surgeon.</p><p><strong>Care Credit can be fair</strong></p><p>I except Care Credit. I find they have plans which are suitable for different kinds of borrowers. Like all credit, it comes with a cost, but allows you to have what you need or desire today while paying for it over time.</p><p><em>Breast Implants after breast reduction surgery</em></p><p>Yes, it is certainly possible and reasonable to have breast implants placed after having had a breast reduction.  If you have redeveloped drooping as you have lost weight and volume in the breasts, you may even need a breast lift at the same time.<br>
 I would recommend meeting with a board-certified plastic surgeon to go over your options.  If you are able to get your operative records from your breast reduction surgery, that is typically very helpful information for your surgeon.</p><p>Yes this can be done, and, in fact, occurs quite commonly. This helps fill up the cleavage line and make breasts perkier. You may need some additional lifting which will occur using existing scars.</p><h5>Melbourne Implants can be replaced through an old axillary (armpit) incision but it is complicated.</h5><p>The axillary approach is done at a distance. That is, a tunnel from the armpit to the submammary space is created so the implant can be properly places. This complicates revisional surgery since endoscopic equipment will be needed to remove the capsule (which probably should be done).<br>
I think it better to go through an inframammary approach. The operation is direct, shorter, and probably a little safer. </p><h5>Breast Augmentation after Breast Feeding</h5><p>Typically I advise my patients to wait at least 3 to 6 months after they stop breastfeeding, this will allow for the breast tissue to settle down from lactating and the breast to reach the final post partum size.</p><p>Some women can still express a small amount of milk up to 9 months after breast feeding. Schedule a consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon to evaluate your options further</p><h3>Who should choose the breast implant placed in you?</h3><p>Safe, high quality medical care should always be centered around the Doctor-Patient Relationship. This is true whether discussing surgical management of a brain cancer, or breast augmentation- if you had a cancer, you would want to have a doctor who cared about you, and who recognized that you are a human being with thoughts, goals, emotions, and opinions, and who respected those…<br>
In other words, you would want a doctor who presented you with options, helped you understand the pros and cons of each option and how these pros and cons were affected by your particular situation and goals, and who then listened to your input and helped you make the choices that are best for you.</p><p>So the short answer to your question is that the two of you, TOGETHER, should ideally make the decision about your implants in Melbourne. Both extremes should cause alarm…</p><p>Returning to the analogy used, if you had a cancer doctor who gave you no education and expected you to choose your treatment, you would be very uncomfortable (knowing that you don’t have the knowledge, training, and experience the cancer surgeon does), right? You would run away and find someone else… </p><p>Similarly, if the doctor gave you very little education, but told you what he/she wanted you to do (in a non-negotiable kind of way), you might be concerned that the doctor doesn’t understand your life, goals, or desires for your future.</p><p>The other side of this coin is that you should also be careful to LISTEN to what your surgeon says- one of the few things that would lead to me telling a patient that I am not comfortable performing their surgery (other than poor health) is if I believe their goals are not realistic, or if the procedure they are asking me for is not (in my opinion) in their long term best interests (for example, I know the patient’s goals will only be met if we do a tummy tuck, but they are insisting on liposuction… this will ALWAYS result in the patient feeling like they did not get the outcome they wanted, and like their money and time were poorly spent- nobody wins). Unfortunately, plastic surgeons, patients, and the media are all to blame for it, but the problem is that too many think of their cosmetic procedure as a “drive-thru” experience.<br>
The reality is that good medical care requires a good relationship. This good relationship, in turn, requires mutual respect and open communication. </p><p>So remember – for you to be safe and happy, think of your plastic surgery experience as an important relationship – treat it with the respect you would any other important relationship, and expect the same respect from the reputable provider you choose in return.</p><h3>Rippling after saline implants</h3><p>Rippling can be seen when the surface of an implant shadows through the tissue, often found where the breast tissue coverage is thin. Some implant styles are more prone such as an overfilled saline implant.</p><p>Others are less prone such as a shaped silicone implant. A subpectoral plane may further decrease your risk of rippling shadowing through, at least at the top portions of the breast. If you have very thin breast tissue on the sides, then you may still have some rippling that is either visible or palpable.<br>
I would visit with a board certified plastic surgeon to discuss your options in more detail.</p><p><b>Silicone implants have less rippling than saline implants in Melbourne</b></p><p>Silicone implants ripple less (but still have some rippling) therefore are the preferred implant in a thin patient. </p><p><i>Does Silicone Ripple Less Than Overfilled Saline?</i></p><p>Yes I believe in my hands silicone has less rippling than saline. As for your correct size How could I advise without at least a posted photo.</p><p><strong>Breast asymmetry</strong></p><p>It is hard to predict how each breast will respond to your implants. It also is difficult to say without examining you. Asymmetry will persist if the breast were very different to begin with.</p><h5>Lopsided or tubular breast deformity after surgical correction looks better, just about always</h5><p>Correction of the tubular breast deformity can be quite difficult but the surgical results are typically markedly improved with surgery. The initial goal is to equalize the over all shape and the second goal is to gain size symmetry.</p><p>Sometimes it is a bit diffucult to get the size exactly the same as the tissue is different on either breast and the skin will expand at different rates. In general, the appearance is so much better.</p><p>I find that if you are willing to have the anchor scar placed on the breast (which does exceptionally well in most women) the deformity can be nearly always and almost completely corrected. Check out my breast lift with augmentation photos.<br>
At least 2 of these patient’s had marked asymmetry due to tubular breast. You can see for yourself if you feel comfortable with the expected outcome. </p><p><strong>How to tell if your breast implant has ruptured or deflated</strong></p><p>The signs vary between Saline implants and Silicone implants. A ruptured Saline implant will usually just deflate, usually over the course of several days, and you will notice a definite change in the size and shape of the breast.</p><p>With Silicone implants in Melbourne it can be a bit more difficult to tell. If the shell should rupture, the gel within it will stay within the breast.</p><p>Most often, you might only notice a slight change in the size, shape, or even feel of your breast.<br>
