In his more than 30 years in practice, Dr. Reddy has become a leader in the plastic surgery field, known for providing his patients with incredibly natural-looking results. </p><p>Dr. Reddy specializes in breast enhancement, body contouring, and facial rejuvenation and definition especially eyelid enhancement and rhinoplasty, though his expertise spans a wide range of cosmetic procedures relating to the face and body. He’s also the leading board certified plastic surgeon injector of Botox and dermal fillers in West Palm Beach.</p><p>It’s no surprise why so many have chosen Dr. Reddy to help them reach their aesthetic goals. “The combination of art and science drew me to plastic surgery,” he says. “I love the many ways to create a natural-looking result that can be tailored to a patient’s wants, needs, lifestyle, and life stage.”</p><p>Dr. Reddy’s career inspiration has a personal touchstone, tied to his birthplace. “I grew up in India, and was inspired by Sushruta, one of the earliest surgeons of recorded history (600 B.C.),” he says. “Sushruta is believed to be the first individual to describe rhinoplasty.” Dr. Reddy began his medical career graduating with honors from Andhra Medical College, in Vizag, India. He went on to complete his surgery degree at the Royal College of Surgeons in London, England, and completed his residencies in general surgery at the New York Medical College and plastic surgery at the New Jersey College of Medicine. </p><p>He is board-certified by American Board of Plastic Surgery and a longtime member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, as well as the renowned American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery and many other prestigious associations. He is also a Fellow of both the American College of Surgeons (FACS) and the International College of Surgeons (FICS). This is a unique honor for Dr. Reddy to have, as he’s currently the only board-certified plastic surgeon in the South Florida area to be a member of both of these organizations. </p><p>During a free consultation at his AAAASF nationally accredited West Palm Beach, Florida<br>
